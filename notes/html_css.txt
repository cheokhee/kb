#the <base> tag lets all links open in a new window

style sheet precedence:
1. author style sheet
2. user style sheet
3. user agent style sheet (user agent: browser, or any program that accesses web pages)

how to resolve conflicting properties for an element?
1. where does it come from? style sheet precedence (see above)
2. !important : add more weight to a declaration
3. The more specific a selector is, the more precedence it will get.
4. sort the rules by the order they were defined. Rules that are defined later in the document
   tree have higher precedence than those defined earlier. And rules from an imported style sheet are considered before rules directly in the style sheet.

Margin is outer space of an element, while Padding is inner space of an element. Margin is the space
outside the border of an element, while Padding is the space that is inside the border of it. Margin

CSS selectors: type, class, ID

block element: start on a new line and occupy available width.
inline element: determined by the display property, cannot have a fixed size.

  block: make the element a block-level element
  inline: make the element an inline-level element
  inline-block: behave as a block element, but displayed inline with other elements.
  none: hide the element

box model: every element is a rectangular box: width, height, padding, border, margin
width, height: apply to block element only

inline element: margins only work horizontally (left and right)
paddings work on four sides. but the top and bottom may bleed into the lines
above/below the element.

position: relative (relative to its original position)
used with top: push an element down
used with left: push an element to the right
===
position: absolute -> relative to the closest relatively positioned parent.
if not exist, relative to the body element
position: fixed -> The element is positioned relative to the browser window

CSS animation: transforms, transitions, keyframes

descendant combinator: A B
child combinator: A > B (immediate child only)
adjacent sibling combinator: A + B (A is immediately followed by B)
general sibling combinator: A ~ B (A is followed by B, may or may not be adjacent)
negation selector: :not()
example: p:not(.classy) -> all paragraphs except classy paragraph
---
.class > * + * {
  margin-left: 4px;
}
apply the style starting from the second child
---
===
