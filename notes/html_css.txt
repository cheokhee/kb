style sheet precedence:
1. author style sheet
2. user style sheet
3. user agent style sheet (user agent: browser, or any program that accesses web pages)

how to resolve conflicting properties for an element?
1. where does it come from? style sheet precedence (see above)
2. !important : add more weight to a declaration
3. The more specific a selector is, the more precedence it will get.
4. sort the rules by the order they were defined. Rules that are defined later in the document
   tree have higher precedence than those defined earlier. And rules from an imported style sheet are considered before rules directly in the style sheet.
