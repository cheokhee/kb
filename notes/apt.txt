ubuntu LTS point release: eg. 10.04.3

the public, which includes security fixes, package updates, translation packs updates, etc.

apt-get upgrade vs dist-upgrade
upgrade:
Packages currently installed with new versions available are retrieved and upgraded; under no
circumstances are currently installed packages removed, or packages not already installed retrieved
and installed. New versions of currently installed packages that cannot be upgraded without changing
the install status of another package will be left at their current version.
====
upgrade will not change what is installed (only versions),
will only upgrade existing packages from one version to another.
will not remove existing packages. will not install new packages
---------------------------------------------------------------
dist-upgrade:
do upgrade and more. may remove packages
will install or remove packages as necessary to complete the upgrade,
