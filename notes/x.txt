--from child to parent process
bash --> lxterminal --> openbox --> lxsession --> init --user --> lightdm --session-child --> lightdm --> init

lightdm is also the parent of /usr/bin/X
summary:
lightdm is the parent of /usr/bin/X and "lightdm --session-child"

env variable:
XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP=LXDE
GDMSESSION=Lubuntu

init starts lxdm, which starts X and lxsession

lxsession starts ibus-daemin, openbox, lxpanel, screensaver

openbox is the parent of processes started from menu and keyboard shortcut

/etc/init/lxdm.conf
/etc/lxdm/default.conf -> call startlubuntu, start lxsession
/etc/lxdm/Xsession -> call /etc/X11/Xsession

/etc/X11/xinit/xserverrc -> changed to allow tcp listening: does not work

get lxdm source code.
install packages: pkg-config, intltool, libx11-dev

cannot install libgtk2.0-dev due to dependency hell

lxdm starts X with -nolisten tcp: hard-coded
bottom line: X cannot accept remote connections

after upgrade to 12.04:
become lightdm.

find out which display manager is used:
cat /etc/X11/default-display-manager

#use xev to display key code and keysym
key code: corresponds to a physical key. depends on the X server implementation and the physical keyboard.
keysym: corresponds to the symbol on the key top. have names like Alt_L, Caps_Lock

lightdm configuration:
/usr/share/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d/*.conf
/etc/lightdm/lightdm-gtk-greeter.conf.d/*.conf
/etc/lightdm/lightdm-gtk-greeter.conf
lightdm-gtk-greeter-settings #program to change setting (need sudo)
