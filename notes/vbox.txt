problem encountered when upgrading from 12.04 to 12.10: step #3 fails
upgrade VirtualBox from 4.1.10 to 4.2.12
and do: apt-get install build-essential linux-headers-`uname -r` dkms
also install libglib2.0-dev package: didn't help
get VBoxGuestAdditions.iso 4.2.12 from VirtualBox web site.
sample URL: 
attach iso file to VM. 
iso shows up as /media/adminuser/VBOXADDITIONS_4.2.12_84980/
then run /media/adminuser/VBOXADDITIONS_4.2.12_84980/VBoxLinuxAdditions.run

after upgrade to 13.10:
upgrade VirtualBox from 4.2.12 to 4.3.4
get VBoxGuestAdditions.iso 4.3.4 from VirtualBox web site.
VBox guest additions download: http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/
sample URL: http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/2.2.0/VBoxGuestAdditions_2.2.0.iso
attach iso file to VM. 
iso file shows up as /media/adminuser/VBOXADDITIONS_4.3.4_91027 
then run /media/adminuser/VBOXADDITIONS_4.3.4_91027/VBoxLinuxAdditions.run

Dec 16 2014:
upgrade VirtualBox from 4.3.4 to 4.3.8
get VBoxGuestAdditions.iso 4.3.8 from VirtualBox web site.
run iso file: did not work
do the following:
   apt-get install virtualbox-guest-additions-iso
then mount and run /mnt/disk/VBoxLinuxAdditions.run (see above). This worked

#VirtualBox problem during startup:
piix4_smbus 0000.00.07.0: SMBus base address uninitialized - upgrade bios or use force_addr=0xaddr
#This error is caused by VM having no smbus but Ubuntu always trying to load the module

step #1: check if the module is loaded
lsmod | grep i2c_piix4

step #2:  If so, blacklist it in /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf, by adding the following to the end of the file:- 
blacklist i2c_piix4

step #3: 
update-initramfs -u -k all
