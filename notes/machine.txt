machine learning: generic algorithm that can build its own logic based on the input data.
you need to provide training data.
--> the ability to learn without being explicity programmed.
--> figuring out an equation to solve a specific problem based on some example data
--> using generic algorithms to tell you something interesting about your data without writing any code
specific to the problem you are solving.
--> BEST: about the creation of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions on data.
--> giving knowledge to computers without hard-coding the knowledge
Useful when programming explicit algorithms is unfeasible.

--> supervised learning
supervised: you know the answer and work backwards to figure out the logic
the computer is presented with example inputs and their desired outputs.
the goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs
predictive modeling, learn from past examples
====
you already know the answers to existing data.
you feed the existing data and the corresponding answers to the computer.
the computer is supposed to come up with a general rule that can provide an answer to future data.
classic example: spam filtering

--> unsupervised: you don't know the answer
--> figuring out an equation to solve a specific problem based on some example data
kinda like data mining.

reinforcement learning: the program interacts with a dynamic environment in which it
must perform a certain goal, without the teacher telling it whether it has come close
to its goal (e.g. driving a car).

Deep learning (also known as deep structured learning, hierarchical learning or deep machine
learning) is a branch of machine learning based on a set of algorithms that attempt to model high
level abstractions in data by using a deep graph with multiple processing layers, composed of
multiple linear and non-linear transformations

predictive analytics

algorithms: naive Bayes, nearest neighbor, the mean classifier, the Perceptron
