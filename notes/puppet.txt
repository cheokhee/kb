config language, resource abstraction layer, transaction layer

Each resource is made up of a type (what sort of resource is being managed: packages,services, or cron jobs),
a title (the name of the resource), and a series of attributes (values that specify thestate of the resource -
for example, whether a service is started or stopped).

It returns “facts” about each agent, such as its hostname, IP address, operating system and version, and other configuration items.
