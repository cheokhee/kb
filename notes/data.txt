Mode (statistics) The mode is the value that appears most often in a set of data.

mean: the average

The median is the value separating the higher half of a data sample, a population, or a probability
distribution, from the lower half. In simple terms, it may be thought of as the "middle" value of a
data set. For example, in the data set {1, 3, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9}, the median is 6, the fourth number in
the sample.

spread: how far from the center the data tend to range
standard deviation: the standard measure of spread/dispersion:
deviation: how much the data deviate from one another.

variance is the expectation of the squared deviation of a random variable from its mean,

standard deviation (SD, also represented by the Greek letter sigma or the Latin letter s) is a
measure that is used to quantify the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of data values.
population standard deviation vs sample standard deviation
if the data represents only a sample, use sample standard deviation

random variable: a variable that can take on any value from a set of values.
--> A Random Variable's set of values is the Sample Space.
--> a quantity whose value depends on some random events.
--> A Random Variable is a set of possible values from a random experiment.
discrete random variable: taking on a countable list of values
continuous random variable: taking any value in an interval
example: random variable X = the score on the face of a dice
X could be 1,2,3,4,5,6
so the sample space is {1,2,3,4,5,6}

dimension reduction is the process of reducing the number of random variables under consideration,
via obtaining a set of principal variables. It can be divided into feature selection and feature
extraction.

independent variable
dependent variable
nominal variable: have two or more categories
Dichotomous variables are nominal variables which have only two categories or levels
==
Ordinal variables are variables that have two or more categories just like nominal variables only
the categories can also be ordered or ranked
===
Interval variables are variables for which their central characteristic is that they can be measured
along a continuum and they have a numerical value (for example, temperature measured in degrees)
===
Ratio variables are interval variables, but with the added condition that 0 (zero) of the
measurement indicates that there is none of that variable. So, temperature measured in degrees
Celsius or Fahrenheit is not a ratio variable because 0C does not mean there is no temperature.

nominal variable: use mode
ordinal variable: use median
interval/ratio (not skewed): use mean
interval/ratio (skewed): use median

In machine learning, a target is called a label.
In statistics, a target is called a dependent variable.
A variable in statistics is called a feature in machine learning.
A transformation in statistics is called feature creation in machine learning.

In directed data mining, you are trying to predict a particular data point. eg. the sales price of a
house given information about other houses for sale in the neighborhood
==
In undirected data mining, you are trying to create groups of data, or find patterns in existing
data

Regression is a data mining function that predicts a number. Age, weight, distance, temperature,
income, or sales could all be predicted using regression techniques.
regression: transforms existing data into a numerical prediction for future data

There are a number of independent variables, which, when taken together, produce a result - a
dependent variable. The regression model is then used to predict the result of an unknown dependent
variable, given the values of the independent variables.
==
The price of the house (the dependent variable) is the result of many independent variables - the
square footage of the house, the size of the lot, whether granite is in the kitchen, bathrooms are
upgraded, etc. So, if you've ever bought a house or sold a house, you've likely created a regression
model to price the house. You created the model based on other comparable houses in the neighborhood
and what they sold for (the model), then put the values of your own house into this model to produce
an expected price.
