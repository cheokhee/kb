Mode (statistics) The mode is the value that appears most often in a set of data.

mean: the average

The median is the value separating the higher half of a data sample, a population, or a probability
distribution, from the lower half. In simple terms, it may be thought of as the "middle" value of a
data set. For example, in the data set {1, 3, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9}, the median is 6, the fourth number in
the sample.

spread: how far from the center the data tend to range
standard deviation: the standard measure of spread

variance is the expectation of the squared deviation of a random variable from its mean,

standard deviation (SD, also represented by the Greek letter sigma or the Latin letter s) is a
measure that is used to quantify the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of data values.
population standard deviation vs sample standard deviation
if the data represents only a sample, use sample standard deviation

random variable: a variable that can take on any value from a set of values.
--> A Random Variable's set of values is the Sample Space.
--> a quantity whose value depends on some random events.
--> A Random Variable is a set of possible values from a random experiment.
discrete random variable: taking on a countable list of values
continuous random variable: taking any value in an interval
example: random variable X = the score on the face of a dice
X could be 1,2,3,4,5,6
so the sample space is {1,2,3,4,5,6}

dimension reduction is the process of reducing the number of random variables under consideration,
via obtaining a set of principal variables. It can be divided into feature selection and feature
extraction.

independent variable
dependent variable
nominal variable: have two or more categories
Dichotomous variables are nominal variables which have only two categories or levels
==
Ordinal variables are variables that have two or more categories just like nominal variables only
the categories can also be ordered or ranked
===
Interval variables are variables for which their central characteristic is that they can be measured
along a continuum and they have a numerical value (for example, temperature measured in degrees)
===
Ratio variables are interval variables, but with the added condition that 0 (zero) of the
measurement indicates that there is none of that variable. So, temperature measured in degrees
Celsius or Fahrenheit is not a ratio variable because 0C does not mean there is no temperature.

nominal variable: use mode
ordinal variable: use median
interval/ratio (not skewed): use mean
interval/ratio (skewed): use median

In machine learning, a target is called a label.
In statistics, a target is called a dependent variable.
A variable in statistics is called a feature in machine learning.
A transformation in statistics is called feature creation in machine learning.
