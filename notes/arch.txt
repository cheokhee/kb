arch: did not install grub

go to ubuntu, run update-grub (which uses grub-mkconfig)
uses os-prober to detect arch, added arch to /boot/grub/grub.cfg

During boot, two errors:
#1. complains about root filesystem not being mounted read-write
#NOTE: office desktop only. home laptop no problem
soln: edit /etc/grub.d/30_os-prober to add rw to linux boot option:
result: linux /boot/vmlinuz-linux root=/dev/sda8 rw

#2. cannot load module crc32c
#NOTE: office desktop only. home laptop no problem
workaround: use fallback init ram image during boot:
initrd /boot/initramfs-linux-fallback.img
long-term soln: In /etc/mkinitcpio.conf: add crc32c_intel to MODULES
then do "mkinitcpio -p linux"
this will add crc32c-intel.ko to /boot/initramfs-linux.img

/usr/lib/xorg/modules/drivers
/etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc

/etc/locale.gen , then locale-gen
/etc/locale.conf

pacstrap /mnt base linux linux-firmware

install package: intel-ucode, grub, os-prober, man-db, networkmanager, dhcpcd,
net-tools: route (not installed)
--
grub-install --target=i386-pc /dev/sda
grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg

manually change /boot/grub/grub.cfg, and changes are immediately reflected in grub menu

after installing Linux Mint, booting Arch get this error:
Kernel Panic - not syncing: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block(0,0)
the initrd line was wrong in /boot/grub/grub.cfg

A meta package and a package group can be defined by the packager to denote a set of related
packages. Both can allow to install or uninstall this set of packages simultaneously by using the
meta package or the group name as a substitute for each individual package name. While a group is
not a package, it can be installed in a similar fashion to a package.

The difference between a meta package and a regular package is that a meta package is empty and
exists purely to link related packages together via dependencies. A meta package, often (though not
always) titled with the "-meta" suffix, provides similar functionality to a package group in that it
enables multiple related packages to be installed or uninstalled simultaneously.
