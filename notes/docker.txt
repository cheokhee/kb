Docker is a shipping container system for software applications

Docker is an engine designed to help you package, ship and deploy applications stacks and services as lightweight, portable and isolated containers.
The Docker engine sits directly on top of the host operating system. Its containers share the kernel and hardware of the host machine with roughly the same
overhead as processes launched directly on the host machine.
But Docker itself isn’t a container system; it merely piggybacks off the existing container facilities baked into the OS, such as LXC on Linux.

#private registry
command: docker pull host:5000/rhel6.5
 Error: v1 ping attempt failed with error: Get https://host:5000/v1/_ping: dial tcp: i/o timeout. If this private registry supports only HTTP or HTTPS with an unknown CA certificate, please add `--insecure-registry host:5000` to the daemon's arguments. In the case of HTTPS, if you have access to the registry's CA certificate, no need for the flag; simply place the CA certificate at /etc/docker/certs.d/host:5000/ca.crt
===
Error: v1 ping attempt failed with error: Get http://host:5000/v1/_ping: dial tcp: i/o timeout

solution:
change /etc/default/docker:
DOCKER_OPTS=--insecure-registry=host:5000 # docker 1.5
DOCKER_OPTS=--insecure-registry host:5000 #docker 1.6?
then reboot
the local docker daemon process:
/usr/bin/docker -d --insecure-registry=host:5000 #docker 1.5

push to private registry:
1. name your image like this: host:port/name:tag
2. then push

data volume container
=== purpose: to share data between containers
doc create -v /usr/src/app/logs --name sslog debian:latest

docker volume: directories/files that are not part of the container's union file system.
they are just normal directories/files that are bind mounted into the container.

#mount a host directory as a data volume
docker run -P -d --name cntr-name -v /a/log:/usr/src/app/logs -v ${PWD}/target/config:/usr/src/app/config image:0.1.0

docker run -a : attach stdin, stdout, stderr and pipe it to the shell
docker run -a stdout nimblestratus/rpi-substructure-grepper $PATTERN | wc -l

filter:
docker inspect -f '{{.Config.Labels}}' 4b2b863e87f0

docker run -p 5000:5000 -d --name my-reg registry

docker push localhost:5000/moc-ss
#get tags for a repository:
curl localhost:5000/v1/repositories/library/moc-ss/tags
this also works:
curl localhost:5000/v1/repositories/rhel-node/tags
-----
#delete a repo: need the slash at the end
#syntax: /v1/repositories/(namespace)/(repository)/tags/(tag*)
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:5000/v1/repositories/library/moc-ss/
this also works:
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:5000/v1/repositories/rhel-node/
#delete a tag:
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:5000/v1/repositories/rhel-node/tags/0.1.0

migrating data volume container
backup:
1. docker run --rm --volumes-from dbdata -v $PWD:/backup ubuntu tar cvf /backup/backup.tar /dbdata
restore:
1. docker create -v /dbdata -name DATA2 ubuntu
2. docker run --rm --volumes-from DATA2 -v $PWD:/backup ubuntu tar xvf /backup/backup.tar

T1: no data volume
$ls /usr/src/app/config # two files
config.json.vpp  default-config.json
T2: docker run --rm -it -v ~/config:/usr/src/app/config --entrypoint="/bin/bash" moc-ss:0.1.1 -i
$ls /usr/src/app/config # one file
default-config.json
---
conclusion: data volume shadows original directory

docker swarm: provide clustering capabilities to turn a group of Docker engines into a single,
virtual Docker engine. allow users to treat a group of hosts as a unified resource.
===
docker compose: for building and running applications composed of multiple Docker containers
(indended for development only)
===
docker machine: install and configure docker hosts on local/remote resources. used to provision resources.

ONBUILD: delay execution of certain commands until a child image is built that inherits
the onbuild image.

container management: Rancher, Clocker, Tutum
container orchestration: kubernetes
Apache Mesos: a cluster manager
container orchestration: coordinate containers across multiple machines

So when people compare Docker and Kubernetes to Mesos, they are actually comparing Kubernetes and
Docker Swarm to Marathon running on Mesos.

resources that are namespaced are mapped to a different value on the host. eg. PID 1 in the
container is not PID 1 in the host.  resources that are not namespaced are the same on the host and
the container.

docker storage driver: used to write to container's writable layer.
https://docs.docker.com/storage/storagedriver/select-storage-driver/
==
a docker image is made up of a series of layers. each layer represents an instruction in the
dockerfile. when you create a new container, a new writeable layer is created on top of the
underlying layers.

copy-on-write : a strategy of sharing and copying files for maximum efficiency. if a file exists in
a lower layer and another layer needs it, it just access the file. the first time another layer
needs to modify the file, the file is copied into that layer and modified.

/var/lib/docker/<storage-driver> : where layers are stored

overlay network uses ports 4789 (UDP), 7946 (TCP/UDP), 2377 (TCP)

by default, containers connect to the default bridge network

in terms of Docker, a bridge network uses a software bridge which allows containers connected to the
same bridge network to communicate, while providing isolation from containers which are not
connected to that bridge network.
--
Bridge networks apply to containers running on the same Docker daemon host. For communication among
containers running on different Docker daemon hosts, you can either manage routing at the OS level,
or you can use an overlay network.
--
When you start Docker, a default bridge network (also called bridge) is created automatically, and
newly-started containers connect to it unless otherwise specified. You can also create user-defined
custom bridge networks. User-defined bridge networks are superior to the default bridge network.
--
User-defined bridges provide automatic DNS resolution between containers.
Containers on the default bridge network can only access each other by IP addresses
--
Containers can be attached and detached from user-defined networks on the fly. To remove a container
from the default bridge network, you need to stop the container and recreate it with different
network options.

By default, traffic from containers connected to the default bridge network is not forwarded to the
outside world. To enable forwarding, you need to change two settings. These are not Docker commands
and they affect the Docker host’s kernel.
--
1. Configure the Linux kernel to allow IP forwarding.
$ sysctl net.ipv4.conf.all.forwarding=1
2. Change the policy for the iptables FORWARD policy from DROP to ACCEPT.
$ sudo iptables -P FORWARD ACCEPT

https://docs.docker.com/storage/bind-mounts/
bind mount can be accessed and modified by processes outside Docker.
volume: managed by and accessed through Docker
---
Bind Mount: a file or directory on the host machine is mounted into a
container. The file or directory is referenced by its full or relative
path on the host machine.
---
Volume: a new directory is created within Docker's storage directory
on the host machine, and Docker manages that directory's content.
