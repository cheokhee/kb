C-u C-space : to go back to a saved mark
C-x C-SPC : (pop-global-mark) jumps to the buffer and position of the latest entry in the global
            ring. It also rotates the ring, so that successive uses of C-x C-SPC take you to earlier
            buffers and mark positions.

you can see / change the current buffer encoding with C-x RET f
you can also change the detected encoding to force an other one and reload the file with C-x RET r
you can set an encoding for the next I/O command only with C-x RET c

shell: use comint-mode to run a subshell
The subprocess doesn't see any input until you press Enter. Emacs is acting like a dumb terminal. It
does support color codes, but not things like moving the cursor around, so you can't run
curses-based applications.
