scourge, bane, : something causing misery
(the bane of my life)

cynosure: An object that serves as a focal point of attention and admiration.
Something that serves to guide.

spectral line: atoms absorb and give out light at characteristic wavelengths.
if they swallow more than they emit, the result is a dark line in the spectrum
of a celestial object. if they emit more than they swallow, the result is
a bright line.
Individual elements have their own spectrum. When hydrogen gas is heated,
it gives off only a few narrow colored lines that make up the unique spectral
fingerprint of that element. This is called emission spectrum. If light from
a star passes through a cool cloud of the same gas, the element will absorb
from the light the same colored bands produced by an emission spectrum, leaving
black lines in their place. The result is an absorption spectrum.
absorpton lines are produced when particular wavelenghts of radiation from a
hot source are absorbed by a cooler, intervening medium.

Because the moon completes each rotation in exactly the same time it takes
to revolve the Earth, we can only look at one side of the moon.
+++
the Moon is in a synchronous orbit (meaning it spins exactly once on its axis for
 every one revolution around Earth), forced to show the same face toward Earth for all eternity.

supernova: a cataclysmic explosion of a massive star. an explosion where
a dying star blows off its outer layers.

Right ascension: celestial equivalent of terrestrial longitude.

black body: a body that absorbs all the heat that falls on it.

In computer networking literature, digital bandwidth refers to data rate
measured in bit/s, for example channel capacity (digital bandwidth capacity)
or throughput (digital bandwidth consumption). The reason for this usage
is that the channel capacity in bit/s is proportional to the analogue bandwidth
in hertz according to Hartley's law.

In communication networks, throughput is the amount of digital data per
time unit that is delivered over a physical or logical link, or that is
passing through a certain network node. For example, it may be the amount
 of data that is delivered to a certain network terminal or host computer,
 or between two specific computers. The throughput is usually measured
in bits per second (bits/s or bps), occasionally in data packets per
 second or data packets per timeslot. The term corresponds to digital bandwidth consumption.

Cable modems are primarily used to deliver broadband Internet access,
taking advantage of unused bandwidth on a cable television network.
Like all residential broadband network technologies (e.g. DSL, FTTX,
 Satellite internet, WiMAX), a fixed channel capacity is shared by a
 population of users (in the case of cable internet, users in a neighborhood
share the available capacity provided by a single coaxial cable line).
 Therefore, service speed can vary depending on how many people are using the service at the same time.

octothorpe: the # sign

point-and-shoot vs SLR:
The image that the photographer sees through the viewfinder of a point-and-shoot
camera is not the same image that passes through the primary lens of the camera
 (that is, the lens that projects the image onto the film or,
in the case of digital cameras, the image sensor). Rather, the
image seen in the viewfinder of a point-and-shoot camera passes
 through a separate lens. SLRs, on the other hand, have only one lens,
and a mirror diverts the image from the lens into the viewfinder;
 that mirror then retracts when the picture is taken so that
 the image can be recorded on the film or sensor. It is because
of this method of diverting the image into the viewfinder that
 pictures cannot be previewed on the LCD screens of most digital SLRs.

fluorescence: Fluorescence is a luminescence that is mostly found as an
optical phenomenon in cold bodies, in which the molecular absorption of
a photon triggers the emission of another photon with a longer wavelength.
The energy difference between the absorbed and emitted photons ends up as
 molecular vibrations or heat. Usually the absorbed photon is in the
 ultraviolet range, and the emitted light is in the visible range,

The life of a CFL lamp is significantly shorter if it is only turned on for
 a few minutes at a time: In the case of a 5-minute on/off cycle the lifespan
of a CFL can be up to 85% shorter, reducing its lifespan to the level of an incandescent lamp

Zoning is a term used in urban planning for a system of land-use regulation in various parts of the world.
The word is derived from the practice of designating permitted uses of land based on mapped
zones which separate one set of land uses from another.
Theoretically, the primary purpose of zoning is to segregate uses that are thought
 to be incompatible; in practice, zoning is used as a permitting system to prevent
new development from harming existing residents or businesses.
A term that refers to a system of land-use  regulation that specifies
what can be built on a piece of land.

dentistry:
 The letter part of the code refers to different parts or surfaces of the tooth.
An "M" mesial, or "D" distal, is the front or back surface of the tooth, respectively.
An "O" occlusal, is the top or biting surface of a back tooth (molar or premolar),
and "I" incisal, is the biting edge of front teeth (incisors and canines).
 A "B" buccal, is the surface of the tooth towards the cheek, and an "L" lingual,
 is the surface of the tooth towards the tongue. So if the dentist says number
3MOD, you'll know that you have a cavity on your upper right first molar,
 involving the front, top, and back parts of the tooth.
occlusal: biting surface
mesial: toward the center of the mouth
distal: away from the center of the mouth
facial: toward the face
buccal: toward the cheek
lingual: toward the tongue

silver amalgam: biocompatible (unlikely to iritate living tissue. not actually
cemented to the cavity walls. it is held in place by a close frictional
fit, plus undercutting the cavity  to lock in the in the filling when it hardens.
require at least 24 hours before reaching full strength (do not chew on it for
at least 24 hours). require support from the surrounding tooth to keep it from
chipping or shattering.

composite resin: not as strong as amalgam. not biocompatible, must be separated
from living tissue with bases or liners. easily stained. boundaries between
the tooth and the filling tend to open up.

Dental sealants (also known as "tooth sealants") can play an important role
in helping to prevent tooth decay ("cavities") in some locations on teeth.
 The placement of dental sealants involves your dentist bonding a plastic
 coating into the grooves of your tooth (the tooth's pits and fissures).
 The net result is a smoother tooth surface, one which is less likely to
trap food and plaque and one which is easier to clean with your toothbrush.

PPO: offer a list of dentists/doctors who have agreed to provide services
at a discounted fee.

HMO: dentist/doctor agrees to provide care in exchange for an amount prepaid
by the insurer per consumer per month. (capitation fee)

Blue Cross and Blue Shield consists of a network of local community health service corporations.
A nationwide federation, Blue Cross and Blue Shield operate under and
are covered by state laws as not-for-profit service providers.
Blue Cross covers hospital costs, as well as outpatient care and home care.
Blue Shield plans cover physicians' services, dental, vision, and some
outpatient services. The two plans cooperate with one another
 to provide a form of comprehensive coverage for the subscribers to the plans.

Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) provides prepaid comprehensive health care
 services to an enrolled group of members within a specified area -- controlled
by geography and enrollment allowances. Its doctors are employed by the HMO, on
a salary which is not dictated by the number or patients or the nature of the
 treatment given. The HMO selects its doctors, hospitals and other care facilities,
 which are solely offered under its coverage. An HMO may be contracted by both
for-profit and nonprofit health organizations to provide care.
The enrollee is required to choose a primary care provider, and agree to only see them for medical care.
There is no deductible or coinsurance for health care, and little red tape if you go in for care services.
A benefit of HMOs is the coverage for preventative health care, including
checkups and many testing procedures. In fact, emphasis is placed on preventative medicine
Most HMO coverage is employer-provided, and is group coverage. That
is, a group of people are enrolled at a group rate,
Freedom of choice exists only within the infrastructure of selected doctors
and facilities. To be fully covered by the HMO, the insured has to use
the HMO's previously arranged services.

Staff Model HMOs: is a network of salaried employees of the HMO,
consisting of doctors, physicians and specialists who are employed
s by the HMO, and the facility is often owned by the HMO.
However, most have contracts with other hospitals and physicians to provide
 care to HMO clients at other facilities. Internal medicine physicians,
 family physicians, and pediatricians are chosen from the hospital-based HMO staff

Group Model HMO: A physicians group is contracted by the HMO to provide
its specific services to the enrollees. Rarely are the physicians directly
employed, nor are the HMO participants their only patients.

Independent Practice Associations (IPAs): Individual private practitioners are contracted,
and they are paid a fixed fee per each patient they agree to treat under HMO contract.
They are chosen by the HMO members as the primary care doctors. IPAs offer more choice
 to HMO recipients, since there are a lot of private practice doctors to choose from,
once the HMO contract has been prepared with the physicians. It is also sometimes
 possible to avoid changing your doctor when you change to an IPA-HMO, if a
contract can be established between the HMO and your current doctor(s).

Point Of Service Plans (POS):
 Traditionally, HMOs have kept their costs to a minimum by managing care. To manage
care, HMOs keep medical care and expenses in their network of doctors and facilities.
HMOs commonly frown on its members seeking care outside the network, and maintain
this system by requiring members to pay high out-of-pocket (sometimes footing the
entire bill) costs when care is provided by physicians who are not employed or contracted by the HMO.
The POS was developed to provide HMO members with more choices. Still restricted
 somewhat (not offered by all HMOs or employers., POs plans offer coverage outside
the network of the HMO, but the coverage outside the network resembles traditional
 health care insurance, where it is required to pay a deductible for that care
outside the HMO structure. This coverage is most often chosen by a family that
wishes to see a family physician they have dealt with for years, but who is not
 a part of their HMO system.

Preferred Provider Organization (PPO): A PPO is usually put together by an
insurance company or employer, in that they arrange a network of doctors and
 hospitals to provide care at a lower cost than traditional insurance.
PPOs have higher premiums, and also require the payment of a deductible for health services.
 The system works as though one were simply getting a percentage discount on
medical care. In this manner, it is a fee-for-service policy, rather than
prepaid for services. For coverage outside the network, the insurer pays
less of the bill and the insured has more out-of-pocket expenses. In some
ways the PPO is a lot more lenient. For example, it is not necessary to
choose a primary care physician and only receive care from that provider.

medicare:
   1.   Those 65 or older who are also eligible for Social Security benefits based on their acquired credits and years in the work force.
   2. Those disabled and under the age of 65 -- but they have to meet requirements of Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) through the Disability Determination Service (DDS. of the particular state government.
   3. People any age who have permanent kidney failure.
   4. Those 65 or older who are beneficiaries of Railroad Retirement.
Medicare:
Part A covers costs while hospitalized, and services procured in the
hospital. Inpatient services which are deemed medically necessary are
 covered, as well as hospice care for the terminally ill. Home health
care is fully covered, as well as 80 percent of necessary medical
equipment. If the patient must pay for blood on a regular basis,
Medicare Part A will pick up the payments after the insured pays
for the first three pints (three pints a year). The premium of
part A coverage is covered by FICA taxes as long as one is approved for Social Security.
Part B coverage helps pay for physician services, other medical procedures, and supplies including tests, prescription drugs, speech therapy and other services. Medicare Part B requires that the recipient pay a premium for this coverage.

Medicare Supplement Policies (Medigap):
are not government policies as are Medicare and Medicaid, although Medigap
 may be regulated strictly by some states. In most states, Medigap is offered

coverage is offered by private insurers,

Medicaid: Run by the states, unlike the federally funded Medicare program,
Medicaid provides health coverage for low-income families and individuals who have few assets.

Strategic thinking, planning, and actions reflect the doer's ability to consider
 the big picture, recognize patterns and trends, honor priorities, anticipate
issues, predict outcomes, and have smart alternatives to fall back upon. Strategic
issues deal with overriding mission and purpose, why the organization exists,
how it makes a difference that others don't or can't make, and where it will be in the future.

Tactical refers to the hands-on part of getting the job done, making sure the
strategic goals are met. It's performing each implementation task with quality and efficiency.

The Prudent Man Rule is based on common law stemming from the 1830 Massachusetts
 court decision - Harvard College v. Armory, 9 Pick. (26 Mass.) 446, 461 (1830).
The Prudent Man Rule directs trustees "to observe how men of prudence, discretion
 and intelligence manage their own affairs, not in regard to speculation, but in
regard to the permanent disposition of their funds, considering the probable
income, as well as the probable safety of the capital to be invested"
The fiduciary is required to invest trust assets as a "prudent man" would invest
his own property with the following factors in mind: the needs of beneficiaries,
 the need to preserve the estate (or corpus of the trust) and the amount and
regularity of income. The application of these general principles depends on
the type of account administered. The Prudent Man Rule continues to be the
sprevailing statute in a small number of states.

An application server is a software engine that delivers applications to client computers
 or devices, typically through the Internet and using the HyperText Transfer Protocol.
 Application servers are distinguished from web servers by the extensive use of
server-side dynamic content and frequent integration with database engines.

An application server handles most, if not all, of the business logic and data
access of the application (see Centralization). The main benefit of an application
server is the ease of application development, since applications need not be programmed;
 instead, they are assembled from building blocks provided by the application server.

   1. Prof. Jones: "The university just cut our yearly budget by $10,000."
      Prof. Smith: "What are we going to do?"
      Prof. Brown: "I think we should eliminate one of the teaching assistant positions.
		That would take care of it."
      Prof. Jones: "We could reduce our scheduled raises instead."
      Prof. Brown: " I can't understand why you want to bleed us dry like that, Jones."

   2. "Senator Jones says that we should not fund the attack submarine program. I disagree entirely.
	I can't understand why he wants to leave us defenseless like that."

   3. Bill and Jill are arguing about cleaning out their closets:
      Jill: "We should clean out the closets. They are getting a bit messy."
      Bill: "Why, we just went through those closets last year. Do we have to clean them out everyday?"
      Jill: "I never said anything about cleaning them out every day. You just want to keep all your
	junk forever, which is just ridiculous."

relay
A relay is a device that allows a small amount of electrical current to control a large amount of current.

Cluster vs. Grid
++
A cluster is a group of computers organized together to perform the same set of functions.
For instance, you may have a cluster running your database software.
++
A grid is a collection of resources. A grid can be composed of multiple clusters.
In Oracle's grid world, you can have a cluster of servers running the database software and a cluster of servers running the Application Server software. Since they are all in the grid, you can move resources from one cluster to another should demands dictate.
+++
In sum, a cluster is one large computer made up of small, similar computers, just
 as R.A.I.D. is one large hard disk made up of small hard disks. Whereas a grid is a bunch of computers that make their unused resources available to select computers (often a single server) over a network.
++
In cluster computing, a bunch of similar (or identical) computers are hooked up locally
(in the same physical location, directly connected with very high speed connections) to operate as
a single computer. The computers that make up the cluster cannot be operated independently
as separate computers. A cluster, as far as any software or other computer is concerned, looks
like essentially one big computer.
++
in grid computing, the computers do not have to be in the same physical location and can be operated
independently. As far as other computers are concerned each computer on the grid is a distinct computer.
Computers on a network have a program on them that allows unused resources (usually processing time and memory)
 to be used by another computer on the network.

middleware: is computer software that connects software components or applications.

An application server, in an n-tier architecture, is a server that hosts an API to expose
business logic and business processes for use by third-party applications.

Business rule is a statement that defines or constrains some aspect of the business. It is
intended to assert business structure or to control or influence the behavior of the business.

business logic:
models real life business objects (such as accounts, loans, itineraries, and inventories)
Business logic comprises:

* business rules that express business policy (such as channels, location, logistics, prices, and products); and
* workflows that are the ordered tasks of passing documents or data from one participant
  (a person or a software system) to anothother

availability: the percentage of time that a system operates during its intended duty cycle.
High availability: specifies an amount of time as a percentage of the intended duty
cycle that a system must be functional.
+++
High availability vs. fault tolerance
The difference between fault tolerance and high availability, is this: A fault tolerant
 environment has no service interruption but a significantly higher cost, while a highly
 available environment has a minimal service interruption.
+++
Fault tolerance relies on specialized hardware to detect a hardware fault and instantaneously
switch to a redundant hardware component whether the failed component is a processor, memory board,
 power supply, I/O subsystem, or storage subsystem. Although this cutover is apparently
seamless and offers non-stop service, a high premium is paid in both hardware cost and
performance because the redundant components do no processing. More importantly, the fault
tolerant model does not address software failures, by far the most common reason for downtime.
++++++
High availability views availability not as a series of replicated physical components, but
rather as a set of system-wide, shared resources that cooperate to guarantee essential
services. High availability combines software with industry-standard hardware to minimize
 downtime by quickly restoring essential services when a system, component, or application
fails. While not instantaneous, services are restored rapidly, often in less than a minute.

In all fairness,

astringent
is a chemical that tends to shrink or constrict body tissues, usually locally after topical
medicinal application.
++++
Astringency is also the dry, puckering mouthfeel caused by tannins found in many fruits such as
blackthorn, chokecherry, bird cherry and persimmon fruits, and banana skins. The tannins denature
 the salivary proteins, causing a rough "sandpapery" sensation in the mouth.
+++
Astringent substances are also found in some red wines and teas.
+++
Astringent medicines cause shrinkage of mucous membranes or exposed tissues and are often used
internally to check discharge of blood serum or mucous secretions. This can happen with a sore
throat, hemorrhages, diarrhea, or with peptic ulcers. Externally applied astringents, which
cause mild coagulation of skin proteins, dry, harden, and protect the skin.

Impromptu speaking

Impromptu Response Structures

* The first one is called PREP: Position, reason, example, position (PREP). In this model,
first you state your position on the topic, and then you state your reason for taking that position.
 Next, you provide an example or story that supports your reason. Finally, you summarize by restating
your position.
* The second structure is called PEP: Point, Example, Point (PEP). It's easier than the first one
and can be used to answer a wider variety of questions. In this one you start by briefly making
a point or stating a key idea or objective. Then you give an example or story that proves your point.
Then you wrap up by restating the main idea, or your main point. When you are short on time, this is
the way to go.
*** PEP: Point, evidence, point:
Obesity is a serious problem in the United States (Point).
Obesity is associated with over 100,000 deaths per year (Evidence).
The National Institutes of Health reported that about two-thirds of U.S. adults are obese (Point).
**** PEP: point, example, point:
I like to relax and enjoy warm, sunny, tropical beaches for my vacations.
For example, I'll be heading to an all-inclusive resort in Panama this year.
We'll be able to scuba dive, swim, kayak and just chill on the beach and my mother-in-law,
 who happens to live only 25 minutes from the resort, will takes care of my girls.
++++++++++++
* The final structure calls for you to quickly think of a way to divide up your response. I call
 this one divide and conquer. There are a few classic two and three part divisions that you'll want
to memorize such as: past, present, future; problem, solution; cost, benefit; us, them;
ideal, real; low, medium, high. Of course, there are many of these, so try to practice the
 ones that are common to your field. These are easy, you just pick an appropriate division
and then include a little bit for each section.

hashing
Hashing is the transformation of a string of characters into a usually shorter fixed-length value
or key that represents the original string. Hashing is used to index and retrieve items in a
 database because it is faster to find the item using the shorter hashed key than to find it
 using the original value. It is also used in many encryption algorithms.
+++
A hash function is any well-defined procedure or mathematical function which converts a large,
possibly variable-sized amount of data into a small datum, usually a single integer that may
serve as an index into an array. The values returned by a hash function are called hash values,
hash codes, hash sums, or simply hashes.

transitive closure:
in computer science the concept of transitive closure can be thought of as constructing
a data structure that makes it possible to answer reachability questions [1]. That is,
can one get from node a to node d in one or more hops? A binary relation tells you only
 that node a is connected to node b, and that node b is connected to node c, etc. After
the transitive closure is constructed, as depicted in the following figure, in an O(1)
operation one may determine that node d is reachable from node a. The data structure is
typically stored as a matrix, so if matrix[1][4] = 1, then it is the case that node 1
can reach node 4 through one or more hops.
+++
Transitive closure can be thought of as establishing a data structure that makes
it possible to solve reachability questions (can I get to x from y?) efficiently.
After the preprocessing of constructing the transitive closure, all reachability
queries can be answered in constant time by simply reporting a matrix entry. Transitive
closure is fundamental in propagating the consequences of modified attributes of a graph G.
 For example, consider the graph underlying any spreadsheet model, where the vertices are
cells and there is an edge from cell $i$ to cell j if the result of cell j depends on
cell i. When the value of a given cell is modified, the values of all reachable cells
must also be updated. The identity of these cells is revealed by the transitive closure
of G. Many database problems reduce to computing transitive closures, for analogous reasons.
+++
related to directed graph
+++
Several graph-based algorithms have been proposed in the literature to compute
the transitive closure of a directed graph
+++
transitive closure is a data structure for answering reachability questions:
can I get from point A to point B? usually in the form of a matrix,
e.g., matrix[1][4]=1 means I can go from point 1 to point 4.

fault-tolerance
replication:
Providing multiple identical instances of the same system or subsystem, directing tasks
or requests to all of them in parallel, and choosing the correct result on the basis of a quorum;
++++
redundancy: Providing multiple identical instances of the same system and switching to one
of the remaining instances in case of a failure (failover);

storage area network (SAN)
is an architecture to attach remote computer storage devices (such as disk arrays, tape libraries,
and optical jukeboxes) to servers in such a way that the devices appear as locally attached to
the operating system.
++++
Network-attached storage (NAS)
vs SAN: uses file-based protocols such as NFS or SMB/CIFS where it is clear that the storage is remote,
and computers request a portion of an abstract file rather than a disk block.
is file-level computer data storage connected to a computer network providing data access to
heterogeneous network clients.
++++
difference
A NAS is a single storage device that operate on data files, while a SAN is a local
 network of multiple devices that operate on disk blocks.
+++
difference
SAN: uses Fibre Channel interconnects (wire), encapsulated SCSI (protocol)
NAS: uses Ethernet and TCP/IP

Java generics
allow "a type or method to operate on objects of various types while providing compile-time type safety
++++
allows the programmer to specify the type that will be accepted by an object.
classic example: collection framework
by default, a collection can accept any object.
generics allows the programmer to create a collection that accepts only
a certain of objects. This allows the compiler to check the type correctness
of the program at compile-time.
+++
allow programmer to specify concrete types to general purpose classes and methods
that operated on Object.
allow you to limit what kind of objects can be inserted into the collection.
+++
Generic programming is a style of computer programming in which algorithms are written
in terms of to-be-specified-later types that are then instantiated when needed for specific
types provided as parameters.
====
allow you to write code that operates on objects whose types have not been determined.
=====
called generics in Java and C#, template in C++, parameterized type by gang of four.
+++
type erasure:
When a generic type is instantiated, the compiler translates those types by a technique called
type erasure  a process where the compiler removes all information related to type parameters
 and type arguments within a class or method. Type erasure enables Java applications that use
generics to maintain binary compatibility with Java libraries and applications that were
 created before generics.
e.g. ArrayList<String> is translated to ArrayList, which is called the raw type.
raw type: a generic class without any type arguments.
++++
A class is generic if it declares one or more type variables. These type variables are known
as the type parameters of the class.

canonical:
Authoritative or standard; conforming to an accepted rule or procedure.
When referring to programming, canonical means conforming to well-established patterns or rules.
When referring to IP addressing, canonical means the authoritative host name stored
in a DNS database that all of an IP address aliases resolve to.
+++

canonicalization
in computer science, canonicalization (abbreviated c14n, where 14 represents the number of letters
between the C and the N) is a process for converting data that has more than one possible
representation into a "standard" canonical representation.

bookmarklet
A bookmarklet is an applet, a small computer application, stored as the URL of a bookmark
 in a web browser or as a hyperlink on a web page. The term is a portmanteau of
the terms bookmark and applet. Whether bookmarklet utilities are stored as bookmarks
or hyperlinks, they are designed to add one-click functionality to a browser or web
 page. When clicked, a bookmarklet performs some function, one of a wide variety
such as a search query or data extraction. Usually the applet is a JavaScript program.

Objects In Mirror Are Closer Than They Appear
passenger-side side-view mirror
passenger-side mirrors are convex to allow the drivers to get a wide-angle view of the road
-- behind them and to the sides -- but at the same time, causes objects to appear more distant.
A flat mirror used on driver's side mirrors, on the other hand, would not provide a wider view
of the road.

ODBC
a standard that enables applications to interact with different db. a wrapper around
databases that makes all db behave in a consistent and clearly defined fashion.
It accomplishes this by using s/w drivers that two primary functions. First, they
encapsulate any native db features and hide these from the client. Second, they provide
a common language for interacting with the db.
ODBC client applications do not interact with db directly. Instead, they interact with
ODBC data sources. a data source is logical db that includes the driver (each db type
has its own driver) and info on how to connect to the db.

Wiki is a piece of server software that allows users to freely create and edit
 Web page content using any Web browser. Wiki supports hyperlinks and has a simple
text syntax for creating new pages and crosslinks between internal pages on the fly.
Wiki is unusual among group communication mechanisms in that it allows the
 organization of contributions to be edited in addition to the content itself.

copy-on-write
an optimizing strategy in computer programming. here's how it works.
let's say multiple processes want to access a resource. instead of giving
each process a copy of the resource, you give them a pointer to the same resource.
when one of the processes tries to modify the resource, you create a private copy
for that process. this prevents the changes from becoming visible to everyone else.

shadow paging
a copy-on-write technique for avoiding in-place updates of pages. when a page is to
be modified, a shadow page is allocated. The shadow page is then modified (the
original page is unchanged). when the shadow page is ready to become persistent,
all pages that refer to the original are updated to refer to the new replacement page.

hypervisor,
also called virtual machine monitor (VMM), is a piece of software/hardware platform-virtualization
software that allows multiple operating systems to run on a host computer concurrently.
+++
Type 1 (or native, bare-metal) hypervisors are software systems that run directly on the
host's hardware to control the hardware and to monitor guest operating-systems.
A guest operating system thus runs on another level above the hypervisor.
examples include VMware ESX Server, Microsoft Hyper-V
+++
Type 2 (or hosted) hypervisors are software applications running within a conventional
operating-system environment. Considering the hypervisor layer as a distinct software
layer, guest operating systems thus run at the third level above the hardware.
Examples include VMware Server (formerly known as GSX), VMware Workstation,
 VMware Fusion, the open source QEMU, Microsoft Virtual PC and Microsoft Virtual Server products,

========= cloud computing ==========
cloud computing
The cloud is a metaphor for "the Internet."
cloud computing means using the Internet to provide your programs and store your data.
+++
a general term for anything that involves delivering hosted services over the Internet.
These services are broadly divided into three categories: Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS),
Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS).
+++
A cloud service has three distinct characteristics that differentiate it from traditional
hosting. It is sold on demand, typically by the minute or the hour; it is elastic -- a
user can have as much or as little of a service as they want at any given time; and
the service is fully managed by the provider (the consumer needs nothing but a personal
computer and Internet access).
+++
Infrastructure-as-a-Service like Amazon Web Services provides virtual server instances
with unique IP addresses and blocks of storage on demand. Customers use the provider's
application program interface (API) to start, stop, access and configure their virtual
servers and storage
+++
Platform-as-a-service in the cloud is defined as a set of software and product
 development tools hosted on the provider's infrastructure. Developers create
applications on the provider's platform over the Internet. PaaS providers may
use APIs, website portals or gateway software installed on the customer's computer.
 Force.com, (an outgrowth of Salesforce.com) and GoogleApps are examples of PaaS.
+++
In the software-as-a-service cloud model, the vendor supplies the hardware infrastructure,
 the software product and interacts with the user through a front-end portal. SaaS is
a very broad market. Services can be anything from Web-based email to inventory control
and database processing. Because the service provider hosts both the application and
the data, the end user is free to use the service from anywhere.

container: a run-time environment for components.

servlet: purpose is to receive HTTP requests, generate dynamic data (usually in HTML),
and delver an HTTP response.
Servlets are pure Java objects that generate HTML by writing it to a stream. The files
do not contain any HTML tags; they simply contain Java code which write out HTML (as strings)
 to produce the page that is sent to the user's browser.

JSP: an HTML page containing embedded java code. an HTML page embedded with java code.

JSPs and servlets are two different ways to accomplish the same goal: generating dynamic HTML pages
 using Java code. One puts Java code in your HTML, and one puts HTML in your Java code.
Functionally, they are equivalent. In fact, under the covers, the web server takes a JSP and
converts it to the corresponding servlet and dynamically compiles it.

JSPs live in an object called a container, which is essentially a server

computer architecture.
+++
The southbridge can usually be distinguished from the northbridge by not being directly
 connected to the CPU. Rather, the northbridge ties the southbridge to the CPU.

Design by Contract (DbC) or Programming by Contract is an approach to designing computer
software. It prescribes that software designers should define formal, precise and verifiable
interface specifications for software components, which extend the ordinary definition
of abstract data types with preconditions, postconditions and invariants.
+++
preconditions: what must be true when the method is called
postconditions: what must be true after the method completes
class invariant: what must be true about each instance of a class
+++
design by contract says that there are 3 concepts about any piece of code:
preconditions, postconditions, and invariants
+++
precondition: expect a certain condition to be true on entry
postcondition: guarantee a certain condition on exit
invariant: maintain a certain condition
--- 3 questions about the contract:
what does the contract expect?
what does the contract guarantee?
what does the contract maintain?

virtual memory
An imaginary memory area supported by some operating systems
in conjunction with the hardware. You can think of virtual memory as an alternate set of
 memory addresses. Programs use these virtual addresses rather than real addresses to store
instructions and data. When the program is actually executed, the virtual addresses are
converted into real memory addresses.
The purpose of virtual memory is to enlarge the address space, the set of addresses a program
 can utilize. For example, virtual memory might contain twice as many addresses as main memory.
 A program using all of virtual memory, therefore, would not be able to fit in main memory all
 at once. Nevertheless, the computer could execute such a program by copying into main memory
those portions of the program needed at any given point during execution.
To facilitate copying virtual memory into real memory, the operating system divides virtual
 memory into pages, each of which contains a fixed number of addresses. Each page is stored
on a disk until it is needed. When the page is needed, the operating system copies it from
disk to main memory, translating the virtual addresses into real addresses.
+++
 gives an application program the impression that it has contiguous working memory
(an address space), while in fact it may be physically fragmented and may even
 overflow on to disk storage.

thrashing
In systems that use virtual memory, the resulting condition of a hard drive being used
 excessively for virtual memory because the physical memory (i.e., RAM) is full.
(The process of moving data into and out of virtual memory also is called swapping pages.)

ecliptic

solar day
the time it takes for the earth to complete one rotation with respect to the sun (24 hr)
the length of the solar day fluctuates throughout the year.
the average length is 24 hr: mean solar day

sidereal day
the time it takes for the earth to complete one rotation with respect to the stars (23 hr 56 minutes)

equation of time
the difference between the true solar day and the mean solar day
fictitious mean sun crosses the prime meridian at noon universal time
====
equation of time
The difference in time between what your watch reads and the position of the sun
(clock time vs. sun time) is called the Equation-of-Time. If you are in the northern
 hemisphere and the sun's position is to the east of where your watch indicates it
would be, the Equation-of-Time is negative. If the sun is to the west, the Equation-of-Time is positive.

SAX
an event-based API for parsing XML docuents. it defines various events that are
triggered while an XML parser is reading an xml document.
a custom handler can listen for these events and process the document
the handler implements the relevant callback methods and responds to various events
push model. data is pushed to the application.
When you use a SAX parser you pass a handler object to the SAX parser. This handler
object has a method for every "event" you want to handle, during the traversal of the XML document.
--> a callback-based API

SAX uses a "push" model, and StAX uses a "pull" model.
The SAX push model means that it is the SAX parser that calls your handler,
The StAX pull model means that it is your "handler" class that calls the parser,

SAX: has Schema Validation  ; no subparsing; no XML writing

test fixture
A test fixture is something used to consistently test some item, device, or piece of software.
a test fixture is all the things that must be in place in order to run a test and expect a particular outcome.
frequently fixtures are created by handling setUp() and tearDown()  events of the unit testing framework. In setUp()  one would create the expected state for the test, and in tearDown()  it would clean up what had been set up.

Four phases of a test:
   1. Set up -- Setting up the test fixture.
   2. Exercise -- Interact with the system under test.
   3. Verify -- Determine whether the expected outcome has been obtained.
   4. Tear down -- Tear down the test fixture to return to the original state.

Class of service (CoS):
is a way of managing traffic in a network by grouping similar types of traffic
(for example, e-mail, streaming video, voice, large document file transfer) together
 and treating each type as a class with its own level of service priority. Unlike Quality
of Service (QoS) traffic management, Class of Service technologies do not guarantee a level
 of service in terms of bandwidth and delivery time; they offer a "best-effort." On the other
hand, CoS technology is simpler to manage and more scalable as a network grows in structure
 and traffic volume. One can think of CoS as "coarsely-grained" traffic control and QoS as
 "finely-grained" traffic control.
+++++++++++
a form of priority queuing that has been used in a number of communication and networking protocols.
It is a way of classifying and prioritizing packets based on application type
++++
CoS is a queuing discipline while QoS covers a wider range of techniques to manage bandwidth and network resources.
+++
As an analogy, CoS is like classifying packages for delivery via regular mail, second-day delivery,
or next-day delivery. QoS is what the delivery company does to ensure your packages are delivered
on time (such as package tracking, air transport, door-to-door pickup and drop-off).

coupling: the degree to which a module depends on another module.
cohesion: a measure of how strongly-related or focused the responsibilities of a single module are

Good cohesion is desired within object-oriented programming so that each class has a well defined purpose and therefore contains the variables and methods necessary to fulfill that purpose.
low coupling often correlates with high cohesion

MapReduce
from lisp:
map:
let's say we have a square function: square(x) = x*x

calling map square [1,2,3,4,5] will return [1,4,9,16,25], as map will go through the
 list, and apply the function square to each element.

reduce/fold:
folding of the list [1,2,3,4,5] with the addition operator would result in 15, the
 sum of the elements of the list [1,2,3,4,5]

In Lisp, a map takes as input a function and a sequence of values. It then applies
 the function to each value in the sequence. A reduce combines all the elements of a
sequence using a binary operation. For example, it can use "+" to add up all the elements in the sequence.

mapreduce of google:

map: takes an input pair and produces a set of intermediate key/value pairs.
reduce: accepts an intermediate key and a set of values for that key. It merges together these
 values to form a possibly smaller set of values.

e.g.
consider the problem of counting the number of occurrences of each word in a large collection of documents:

map(String key, String value):
// key: document name
// value: document contents
for each word w in value:
  EmitIntermediate(w, "1");

reduce(String key, Iterator values):
// key: a word
// values: a list of counts
int result = 0;
for each v in values:
  result += ParseInt(v);
Emit(AsString(result));

The map function emits each word plus an associated count of occurrences ("1" in this example).
 The reduce function sums together all the counts emitted for a particular word.
Here, each document is split in words, and each word is counted initially with a "1" value by the Map
 function, using the word as the result key. The framework puts together all the pairs with the same
 key and feeds them to the same call to Reduce, thus this function just needs to sum all of its
 input values to find the total appearances of that word.

JVM heap: an area of memory used for dynamic memory allocation. divided into 3 generations:
    * The young generation stores short-lived objects that are created and immediately garbage collected.
    * Objects that persist longer are moved to the old generation (also called the tenured generation).
    * The permanent generation (or permgen) is used for class definitions and associated metadata.

page cache / disk cache

materialized view
the query result is cached  as a concrete table that may be updated from the original base
 tables from time to time. This enables much more efficient access, at the cost of some data
being potentially out-of-date. It is most useful in data warehousing scenarios, where frequent
 queries of the actual base tables can be extremely expensive.
A materialized view is a database object that contains the results of a query. They are local
 copies of data located remotely, or are used to create summary tables based on aggregations
 of a table's data. Materialized views, which store data based on remote tables are also, know as snapshots.
the material view is manifested as a real table.
==> regular view:
a view is a virtual table representing the result of a database query. Whenever an ordinary view's
 table is queried or updated, the DBMS converts these into queries or updates against the underlying
 base tables

 is a notation for representing a fixed value in source code. Almost all programming languages have
 notations for atomic values such as integers, floating-point numbers, strings, and booleans;
 some also have notations for elements of enumerated types and compound values such as arrays, records, and objects.
--> something that represents a fixed value, such as string, integer, boolean, etc in source code

java synchronization
synchronization is required for reliable inter-thread communications as well as for mutual exclusion.
when multiple threads share mutable data, each thread that reads or writes the data must perform
synchronization. Otherwise, there is no guarantee that one thread's changes will be visible to another.

Code refactoring is the process of changing a computer program's source code without modifying its
 external functional behavior in order to improve some of the nonfunctional attributes of the software.

WebSocket is a technology providing for bi-directional, full-duplex communications channels, over
 a single Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) socket, designed to be implemented in web browsers
and web servers but can be utilised by any client or server application.
part of the HTML5 initiative
+++
introduced the WebSocket JavaScript interface, which defines a full-duplex single socket connection
 over which messages can be sent between client and server. The WebSocket standard attempts to
simplify much of the complexity around bi-directional web communication and connection management.
=====
WebSockets represent an alternative to Comet and Ajax.
+++
This specification defines an API that enables Web pages to use the WebSocket protocol for two-way
 communication with a remote host.
++++
provides for full duplex communication between a browser and a server

the original model of the web, in which a browser requests a complete web page at a time.
++++++
Comet is a web application model in which a long-held HTTP request allows a web server to push data to a browser, without the browser explicitly requesting it.
The use of Comet techniques predates the name Comet, and is also known by several other names,
 including Ajax Push, Reverse Ajax, Two-way-web, HTTP Streaming, and HTTP server push

Push technology, or server push, describes a style of Internet-based communication where the request
 for a given transaction is initiated by the publisher or central server.
It is contrasted with pull technology, where the request for the transmission of information is
 initiated by the receiver or client.

duck typing
the type of an object is defined by what it can do
This method of not caring about the actual type of a variable, just relying on what methods
 it supports is known as Duck Typing.

edge case
a problem or situation that occurs only at an extreme (maximum or minimum) operating parameter.

boundary case is frequently used in software engineering  to refer to the behavior of a system when
 one of its inputs is at or just beyond its maximum or minimum limits. It is frequently used when
discussing software testing.
For example, if an input field is meant to accept only integer values 0 - 100, entering the
 values -1, 0, 100, and 101 would represent the boundary cases.
=====
It is commonly thought that three cases should be used when boundary testing (one on the boundary,
 and one on either side to it). However, the case on the valid side of the boundary is redundant,
 and so equivalence partitioning recommends skipping it.

corner case (or pathological case) is a problem or situation that occurs only outside of normal
 operating parameters   specifically one that manifests itself when multiple environmental
variables or conditions are simultaneously at extreme levels, even though each parameter is
within the specified range for that parameter.
+++
Contrast a corner case with an edge case, an issue that occurs only at a (single) maximum or
 minimum parameter. For example, a speaker that distorts audio at maximum volume, even in
the absence of other extreme settings or conditions.

Behavior driven development (or BDD) is an agile software development technique that encourages
 collaboration between developers, QA and non-technical or business participants in a software project.
++
BDD focuses on obtaining a clear understanding of desired software behaviour through discussion
 with stakeholders. It extends TDD by writing test cases in a natural language that non-programmers can read.

first, you get all the persons: select name from person_table;
then for each person, you get an address: select address from address_table where person_name = ?
hence N+1
solution: use joins
select person_table.name, address_table.address
    from person_table left join address_table on (person_table.name = address_table.person_name);

Fermi paradox is the apparent contradiction between high estimates of the probability of the
 existence of extraterrestrial civilizations and the lack of evidence for, or contact with, such civilizations.

wire protocol
refers to a way of getting data from point to point: A wire protocol is needed if more than one application
has to interoperate.
the mechanism for transmitting data from point a to point b
===
In a network, it is the mechanism for transmitting data from point a to point b. It often refers
to a distributed object protocol such as SOAP, CORBA or RMI, which is software only and which
 invokes the running of programs on remote servers.
===
The term is a bit confusing, because it sounds like the physical layer (layer 1) of the network
 that places the bits "onto the wire." In some cases, it may refer to this layer; however, it
generally refers to protocols higher than the physical layer or even the next higher data link
layer (layer 2) such as Ethernet and ATM.

examples of wire protocols are
    * IIOP for CORBA
    * JRMP for RMI
    * SOAP for Web Services

In shipping, breakbulk cargo or general cargo is a term that covers a great variety of goods
 that must be loaded individually, and not in intermodal containers nor in bulk as with oil or grain.

Bulk cargo is commodity cargo that is transported unpackaged in large quantities. This cargo
is usually dropped or poured, with a spout or shovel bucket, as a liquid or as a mass of
 relatively small solids (e.g. grain, coal), into a bulk carrier ship's hold, railroad car,
or tanker truck/trailer/semi-trailer body. Smaller quantities (still considered "bulk") can
 be boxed (or drummed) and palletised. Bulk cargo is classified as liquid or dry.

POSIX
"Portable Operating System Interface for uni-X",
a set of standards for operating systems
Ideally, a developer should have to write a program only once to run on all POSIX-compliant systems.
The POSIX specifications describe an operating system that is similar to, but not necessarily the same as, Unix.

JPA: embeddable
a relationship where the target object's data is embedded in the source object's table is
considered an embedded relationship, and the target object is considered an Embeddable object.
An embeddable object cannot be directly persisted, or queried, it can only be persisted or queried in the context of its parent. An embeddable object does not have an id or table.

JPA Orphan removal will ensure that any object no longer referenced from the sourceis deleted
 from the database.

JPA cascading : allows the relationship to be cascaded
If persist() is called on the parent, and the child is also new, it will also be persisted.
used in one-to-one and one-to-many relationships
cascade options: persist, remove, merge, refresh, all

bean-managed transaction
the code in the session or message-driven bean explicitly marks the boundaries of the transaction.
 An entity bean cannot have bean-managed transactions; it must use container-managed transactions
instead. Although beans with container-managed transactions require less coding, they have one
limitation: When a method is executing, it can be associated with either a single transaction
 or no transaction at all. If this limitation will make coding your bean difficult, you should
 consider using bean-managed transactions.

Container-Managed Transactions

session: the facade through which an application accesses EclipseLink functionality
An EclipseLink session provides the primary access to the EclipseLink runtime. It is the means
 by which your application performs all persistence operations with the data source that contains
 persistent objects.

EAV
Conceptually an EAV design involves a single table with three columns, an entity (such as an
olfactory receptor ID), an attribute (such as species, which is actually a pointer into the
 metadata table) and a value for the attribute (e.g., rat). In EAV design, one row stores
 a single fact. In a conventional table that has one column per attribute, by contrast,
 one row stores a set of facts. EAV design is appropriate when the number of parameters
 that potentially apply to an entity is vastly more than those that actually apply to an individual entity.
+++
appropriate when the number of possible attributes is much greater than the number
that will actually apply to a given entity

 are not present, and behavior reuse (known as inheritance in class-based languages) is
performed via a process of cloning existing objects that serve as prototypes. This model
 can also be known as classless, prototype-oriented or instance-based programming.
 Delegation is the language feature that supports prototype-based programming.

JSONP: JSON with padding
a pattern of usage allowing a page to request data from a server in a different domain
--
same origin policy:
 a web page served from server1.example.com cannot normally connect to or communicate
 with a server other than server1.example.com.
---
An exception is the HTML <script> element. Exploiting the open policy for <script> elements,
 some pages use them to retrieve JavaScript code that operates on dynamically generated
JSON-formatted data from other origins. This usage pattern is known as JSONP. Requests
 for JSONP retrieve not JSON, but arbitrary JavaScript code. They are evaluated by
 the JavaScript interpreter, not parsed by a JSON parser.

In computer graphics, a sprite  is a two-dimensional image or animation that is integrated
into a larger scene.
===
CSS sprite:
To reduce the number of requests the browser makes to the server, some web designers combine
 numerous small images or icons into a larger image called a sprite sheet.
 CSS is used to display the parts of the composite image to display at different points
in the page. If a page has 10 1 kB images, they can be combined into one 10 kB image,
 downloaded with a single HTTP request, and then positioned with CSS. Reducing the number
 of HTTP requests can make a Web page load much faster.

concurrency: the execution of disparate tasks at roughtly the same time, each sharing a common
resource.
The result of concurrent tasks often affect the behavior of other concurrent tasks.
+++
Parallelism: refers to partitiioning a task into multiple parts, each run at the same time.
typically, parallel tasks work toward an aggregate goal. The result of one does not affect
the behavior of any other task.
===
concurrency: conceptually simultaneous
parallelism: physically simultaneous
