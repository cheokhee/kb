(the bane of my life)

cynosure: An object that serves as a focal point of attention and admiration.
Something that serves to guide.

spectral line: atoms absorb and give out light at characteristic wavelengths.
if they swallow more than they emit, the result is a dark line in the spectrum
of a celestial object. if they emit more than they swallow, the result is
a bright line.
Individual elements have their own spectrum. When hydrogen gas is heated,
it gives off only a few narrow colored lines that make up the unique spectral
fingerprint of that element. This is called emission spectrum. If light from
a star passes through a cool cloud of the same gas, the element will absorb
from the light the same colored bands produced by an emission spectrum, leaving
black lines in their place. The result is an absorption spectrum.
absorpton lines are produced when particular wavelenghts of radiation from a
hot source are absorbed by a cooler, intervening medium.

Because the moon completes each rotation in exactly the same time it takes
to revolve the Earth, we can only look at one side of the moon.
+++
the Moon is in a synchronous orbit (meaning it spins exactly once on its axis for
 every one revolution around Earth), forced to show the same face toward Earth for all eternity.

a dying star blows off its outer layers.

Right ascension: celestial equivalent of terrestrial longitude.

black body: a body that absorbs all the heat that falls on it.

In computer networking literature, digital bandwidth refers to data rate
measured in bit/s, for example channel capacity (digital bandwidth capacity)
or throughput (digital bandwidth consumption). The reason for this usage
is that the channel capacity in bit/s is proportional to the analogue bandwidth
in hertz according to Hartley's law.

In communication networks, throughput is the amount of digital data per
time unit that is delivered over a physical or logical link, or that is
passing through a certain network node. For example, it may be the amount
 of data that is delivered to a certain network terminal or host computer,
 or between two specific computers. The throughput is usually measured
in bits per second (bits/s or bps), occasionally in data packets per
 second or data packets per timeslot. The term corresponds to digital bandwidth consumption.

Cable modems are primarily used to deliver broadband Internet access,
taking advantage of unused bandwidth on a cable television network.
Like all residential broadband network technologies (e.g. DSL, FTTX,
 Satellite internet, WiMAX), a fixed channel capacity is shared by a
 population of users (in the case of cable internet, users in a neighborhood
share the available capacity provided by a single coaxial cable line).
 Therefore, service speed can vary depending on how many people are using the service at the same time.

octothorpe: the # sign

point-and-shoot vs SLR:
The image that the photographer sees through the viewfinder of a point-and-shoot
camera is not the same image that passes through the primary lens of the camera
 (that is, the lens that projects the image onto the film or,
in the case of digital cameras, the image sensor). Rather, the
image seen in the viewfinder of a point-and-shoot camera passes
 through a separate lens. SLRs, on the other hand, have only one lens,
and a mirror diverts the image from the lens into the viewfinder;
 that mirror then retracts when the picture is taken so that
 the image can be recorded on the film or sensor. It is because
of this method of diverting the image into the viewfinder that
 pictures cannot be previewed on the LCD screens of most digital SLRs.

fluorescence: Fluorescence is a luminescence that is mostly found as an
optical phenomenon in cold bodies, in which the molecular absorption of
a photon triggers the emission of another photon with a longer wavelength.
The energy difference between the absorbed and emitted photons ends up as
 molecular vibrations or heat. Usually the absorbed photon is in the
 ultraviolet range, and the emitted light is in the visible range,

The life of a CFL lamp is significantly shorter if it is only turned on for
 a few minutes at a time: In the case of a 5-minute on/off cycle the lifespan
of a CFL can be up to 85% shorter, reducing its lifespan to the level of an incandescent lamp

Zoning is a term used in urban planning for a system of land-use regulation in various parts of the world.
The word is derived from the practice of designating permitted uses of land based on mapped
zones which separate one set of land uses from another.
Theoretically, the primary purpose of zoning is to segregate uses that are thought
 to be incompatible; in practice, zoning is used as a permitting system to prevent
new development from harming existing residents or businesses.
A term that refers to a system of land-use  regulation that specifies
what can be built on a piece of land.

dentistry:
 The letter part of the code refers to different parts or surfaces of the tooth.
An "M" mesial, or "D" distal, is the front or back surface of the tooth, respectively.
An "O" occlusal, is the top or biting surface of a back tooth (molar or premolar),
and "I" incisal, is the biting edge of front teeth (incisors and canines).
 A "B" buccal, is the surface of the tooth towards the cheek, and an "L" lingual,
 is the surface of the tooth towards the tongue. So if the dentist says number
3MOD, you'll know that you have a cavity on your upper right first molar,
 involving the front, top, and back parts of the tooth.
occlusal: biting surface
mesial: toward the center of the mouth, Situated toward the middle of the front of the jaw along the curve of the dental arch.
distal: away from the center of the mouth, Situated farthest from the middle and front of the jaw, as a tooth or tooth surface.
facial: toward the face
buccal: toward the cheek
lingual: toward the tongue

sealant: resins that are applied in the pits and fissures of the chewing surfaces of teeth
to protect those surfaces. First etch the surface with acid to create a porous
surface to which the resin will adhere.
bonding: used in the restoration of discolored, damaged, or missing teeth.

A cusp is an occlusal or incisal eminence on a tooth.

silver amalgam: biocompatible (unlikely to iritate living tissue. not actually
cemented to the cavity walls. it is held in place by a close frictional
fit, plus undercutting the cavity  to lock in the in the filling when it hardens.
require at least 24 hours before reaching full strength (do not chew on it for
at least 24 hours). require support from the surrounding tooth to keep it from
chipping or shattering.

composite resin: not as strong as amalgam. not biocompatible, must be separated
from living tissue with bases or liners. easily stained. boundaries between
the tooth and the filling tend to open up.

Dental sealants (also known as "tooth sealants") can play an important role
in helping to prevent tooth decay ("cavities") in some locations on teeth.
 The placement of dental sealants involves your dentist bonding a plastic
 coating into the grooves of your tooth (the tooth's pits and fissures).
 The net result is a smoother tooth surface, one which is less likely to
trap food and plaque and one which is easier to clean with your toothbrush.

PPO: offer a list of dentists/doctors who have agreed to provide services
at a discounted fee.

HMO: dentist/doctor agrees to provide care in exchange for an amount prepaid

Blue Cross and Blue Shield consists of a network of local community health service corporations.
A nationwide federation, Blue Cross and Blue Shield operate under and
are covered by state laws as not-for-profit service providers.
Blue Cross covers hospital costs, as well as outpatient care and home care.
Blue Shield plans cover physicians' services, dental, vision, and some
outpatient services. The two plans cooperate with one another
 to provide a form of comprehensive coverage for the subscribers to the plans.

Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) provides prepaid comprehensive health care
 services to an enrolled group of members within a specified area -- controlled
by geography and enrollment allowances. Its doctors are employed by the HMO, on
a salary which is not dictated by the number or patients or the nature of the
 treatment given. The HMO selects its doctors, hospitals and other care facilities,
 which are solely offered under its coverage. An HMO may be contracted by both
for-profit and nonprofit health organizations to provide care.
The enrollee is required to choose a primary care provider, and agree to only see them for medical care.
There is no deductible or coinsurance for health care, and little red tape if you go in for care services.
A benefit of HMOs is the coverage for preventative health care, including
checkups and many testing procedures. In fact, emphasis is placed on preventative medicine
Most HMO coverage is employer-provided, and is group coverage. That
is, a group of people are enrolled at a group rate,
Freedom of choice exists only within the infrastructure of selected doctors
and facilities. To be fully covered by the HMO, the insured has to use
the HMO's previously arranged services.

Staff Model HMOs: is a network of salaried employees of the HMO,
consisting of doctors, physicians and specialists who are employed
s by the HMO, and the facility is often owned by the HMO.
However, most have contracts with other hospitals and physicians to provide
 care to HMO clients at other facilities. Internal medicine physicians,
 family physicians, and pediatricians are chosen from the hospital-based HMO staff

Group Model HMO: A physicians group is contracted by the HMO to provide
its specific services to the enrollees. Rarely are the physicians directly
employed, nor are the HMO participants their only patients.

Independent Practice Associations (IPAs): Individual private practitioners are contracted,
and they are paid a fixed fee per each patient they agree to treat under HMO contract.
They are chosen by the HMO members as the primary care doctors. IPAs offer more choice
 to HMO recipients, since there are a lot of private practice doctors to choose from,
once the HMO contract has been prepared with the physicians. It is also sometimes
 possible to avoid changing your doctor when you change to an IPA-HMO, if a
contract can be established between the HMO and your current doctor(s).

Point Of Service Plans (POS):
 Traditionally, HMOs have kept their costs to a minimum by managing care. To manage
care, HMOs keep medical care and expenses in their network of doctors and facilities.
HMOs commonly frown on its members seeking care outside the network, and maintain
this system by requiring members to pay high out-of-pocket (sometimes footing the
entire bill) costs when care is provided by physicians who are not employed or contracted by the HMO.
The POS was developed to provide HMO members with more choices. Still restricted
 somewhat (not offered by all HMOs or employers., POs plans offer coverage outside
the network of the HMO, but the coverage outside the network resembles traditional
 health care insurance, where it is required to pay a deductible for that care
outside the HMO structure. This coverage is most often chosen by a family that
wishes to see a family physician they have dealt with for years, but who is not
 a part of their HMO system.

Preferred Provider Organization (PPO): A PPO is usually put together by an
insurance company or employer, in that they arrange a network of doctors and
 hospitals to provide care at a lower cost than traditional insurance.
PPOs have higher premiums, and also require the payment of a deductible for health services.
 The system works as though one were simply getting a percentage discount on
medical care. In this manner, it is a fee-for-service policy, rather than
prepaid for services. For coverage outside the network, the insurer pays
less of the bill and the insured has more out-of-pocket expenses. In some
ways the PPO is a lot more lenient. For example, it is not necessary to
choose a primary care physician and only receive care from that provider.

medicare:
   1.   Those 65 or older who are also eligible for Social Security benefits based on their acquired credits and years in the work force.
   2. Those disabled and under the age of 65 -- but they have to meet requirements of Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) through the Disability Determination Service (DDS. of the particular state government.
   3. People any age who have permanent kidney failure.
   4. Those 65 or older who are beneficiaries of Railroad Retirement.
Medicare:
Part A covers costs while hospitalized, and services procured in the
hospital. Inpatient services which are deemed medically necessary are
 covered, as well as hospice care for the terminally ill. Home health
care is fully covered, as well as 80 percent of necessary medical
equipment. If the patient must pay for blood on a regular basis,
Medicare Part A will pick up the payments after the insured pays
for the first three pints (three pints a year). The premium of
part A coverage is covered by FICA taxes as long as one is approved for Social Security.
Part B coverage helps pay for physician services, other medical procedures, and supplies including tests, prescription drugs, speech therapy and other services. Medicare Part B requires that the recipient pay a premium for this coverage.

Medicare Supplement Policies (Medigap):
are not government policies as are Medicare and Medicaid, although Medigap
 may be regulated strictly by some states. In most states, Medigap is offered
 to Medicare recipients over the age of 65, and the coverage picks up where Medicare lacks in coverage
coverage is offered by private insurers,

Medicaid: Run by the states, unlike the federally funded Medicare program,
Medicaid provides health coverage for low-income families and individuals who have few assets.

issues, predict outcomes, and have smart alternatives to fall back upon. Strategic
issues deal with overriding mission and purpose, why the organization exists,
how it makes a difference that others don't or can't make, and where it will be in the future.

Tactical refers to the hands-on part of getting the job done, making sure the
strategic goals are met. It's performing each implementation task with quality and efficiency.

The Prudent Man Rule is based on common law stemming from the 1830 Massachusetts
 court decision - Harvard College v. Armory, 9 Pick. (26 Mass.) 446, 461 (1830).
The Prudent Man Rule directs trustees "to observe how men of prudence, discretion
 and intelligence manage their own affairs, not in regard to speculation, but in
regard to the permanent disposition of their funds, considering the probable
income, as well as the probable safety of the capital to be invested"
The fiduciary is required to invest trust assets as a "prudent man" would invest
his own property with the following factors in mind: the needs of beneficiaries,
 the need to preserve the estate (or corpus of the trust) and the amount and
regularity of income. The application of these general principles depends on
the type of account administered. The Prudent Man Rule continues to be the
sprevailing statute in a small number of states.

An application server is a software engine that delivers applications to client computers
 or devices, typically through the Internet and using the HyperText Transfer Protocol.
 Application servers are distinguished from web servers by the extensive use of
server-side dynamic content and frequent integration with database engines.

An application server handles most, if not all, of the business logic and data
access of the application (see Centralization). The main benefit of an application
server is the ease of application development, since applications need not be programmed;
 instead, they are assembled from building blocks provided by the application server.

a stand-in created to draw attention away from the central issue
===
The Straw Man fallacy is committed when a person simply ignores a person's actual position
and substitutes a distorted, exaggerated or misrepresented version of that position.
This sort of "reasoning" has the following pattern:

   1. Person A has position X.
   2. Person B presents position Y (which is a distorted version of X).
   3. Person B attacks position Y.
   4. Therefore X is false/incorrect/flawed.

Examples of Straw Man

   1. Prof. Jones: "The university just cut our yearly budget by $10,000."
      Prof. Smith: "What are we going to do?"
      Prof. Brown: "I think we should eliminate one of the teaching assistant positions.
		That would take care of it."
      Prof. Jones: "We could reduce our scheduled raises instead."
      Prof. Brown: " I can't understand why you want to bleed us dry like that, Jones."

   2. "Senator Jones says that we should not fund the attack submarine program. I disagree entirely.
	I can't understand why he wants to leave us defenseless like that."

   3. Bill and Jill are arguing about cleaning out their closets:
      Jill: "We should clean out the closets. They are getting a bit messy."
      Bill: "Why, we just went through those closets last year. Do we have to clean them out everyday?"
      Jill: "I never said anything about cleaning them out every day. You just want to keep all your
	junk forever, which is just ridiculous."

relay
A relay is a device that allows a small amount of electrical current to control a large amount of current.

Cluster vs. Grid
++
A cluster is a group of computers organized together to perform the same set of functions.
For instance, you may have a cluster running your database software.
++
A grid is a collection of resources. A grid can be composed of multiple clusters.
In Oracle's grid world, you can have a cluster of servers running the database software and a cluster of servers running the Application Server software. Since they are all in the grid, you can move resources from one cluster to another should demands dictate.
+++
In sum, a cluster is one large computer made up of small, similar computers, just
 as R.A.I.D. is one large hard disk made up of small hard disks. Whereas a grid is a bunch of computers that make their unused resources available to select computers (often a single server) over a network.
++
In cluster computing, a bunch of similar (or identical) computers are hooked up locally
(in the same physical location, directly connected with very high speed connections) to operate as
a single computer. The computers that make up the cluster cannot be operated independently
as separate computers. A cluster, as far as any software or other computer is concerned, looks
like essentially one big computer.
++
in grid computing, the computers do not have to be in the same physical location and can be operated
independently. As far as other computers are concerned each computer on the grid is a distinct computer.
Computers on a network have a program on them that allows unused resources (usually processing time and memory)
 to be used by another computer on the network.

middleware: is computer software that connects software components or applications.

An application server, in an n-tier architecture, is a server that hosts an API to expose
business logic and business processes for use by third-party applications.

Business rule is a statement that defines or constrains some aspect of the business. It is
intended to assert business structure or to control or influence the behavior of the business.

business logic:
models real life business objects (such as accounts, loans, itineraries, and inventories)
Business logic comprises:

* business rules that express business policy (such as channels, location, logistics, prices, and products); and
* workflows that are the ordered tasks of passing documents or data from one participant
  (a person or a software system) to anothother

come down on the side of

availability: the percentage of time that a system operates during its intended duty cycle.
High availability: specifies an amount of time as a percentage of the intended duty
cycle that a system must be functional.
+++
High availability vs. fault tolerance
The difference between fault tolerance and high availability, is this: A fault tolerant
 environment has no service interruption but a significantly higher cost, while a highly
 available environment has a minimal service interruption.
+++
Fault tolerance relies on specialized hardware to detect a hardware fault and instantaneously
switch to a redundant hardware component whether the failed component is a processor, memory board,
 power supply, I/O subsystem, or storage subsystem. Although this cutover is apparently
seamless and offers non-stop service, a high premium is paid in both hardware cost and
performance because the redundant components do no processing. More importantly, the fault
tolerant model does not address software failures, by far the most common reason for downtime.
++++++
High availability views availability not as a series of replicated physical components, but
rather as a set of system-wide, shared resources that cooperate to guarantee essential
services. High availability combines software with industry-standard hardware to minimize
 downtime by quickly restoring essential services when a system, component, or application
fails. While not instantaneous, services are restored rapidly, often in less than a minute.

In all fairness,

astringent
is a chemical that tends to shrink or constrict body tissues, usually locally after topical
medicinal application.
++++
Astringency is also the dry, puckering mouthfeel caused by tannins found in many fruits such as
blackthorn, chokecherry, bird cherry and persimmon fruits, and banana skins. The tannins denature
 the salivary proteins, causing a rough "sandpapery" sensation in the mouth.
+++
Astringent substances are also found in some red wines and teas.
+++
Astringent medicines cause shrinkage of mucous membranes or exposed tissues and are often used
internally to check discharge of blood serum or mucous secretions. This can happen with a sore
throat, hemorrhages, diarrhea, or with peptic ulcers. Externally applied astringents, which
cause mild coagulation of skin proteins, dry, harden, and protect the skin.

Impromptu speaking

Impromptu Response Structures

* The first one is called PREP: Position, reason, example, position (PREP). In this model,
first you state your position on the topic, and then you state your reason for taking that position.
 Next, you provide an example or story that supports your reason. Finally, you summarize by restating
your position.
* The second structure is called PEP: Point, Example, Point (PEP). It's easier than the first one
and can be used to answer a wider variety of questions. In this one you start by briefly making
a point or stating a key idea or objective. Then you give an example or story that proves your point.
Then you wrap up by restating the main idea, or your main point. When you are short on time, this is
the way to go.
*** PEP: Point, evidence, point:
Obesity is a serious problem in the United States (Point).
Obesity is associated with over 100,000 deaths per year (Evidence).
The National Institutes of Health reported that about two-thirds of U.S. adults are obese (Point).
**** PEP: point, example, point:
I like to relax and enjoy warm, sunny, tropical beaches for my vacations.

We'll be able to scuba dive, swim, kayak and just chill on the beach and my mother-in-law,
 who happens to live only 25 minutes from the resort, will takes care of my girls.

* The final structure calls for you to quickly think of a way to divide up your response. I call
 this one divide and conquer. There are a few classic two and three part divisions that you'll want
to memorize such as: past, present, future; problem, solution; cost, benefit; us, them;
ideal, real; low, medium, high. Of course, there are many of these, so try to practice the
 ones that are common to your field. These are easy, you just pick an appropriate division
and then include a little bit for each section.

hashing
Hashing is the transformation of a string of characters into a usually shorter fixed-length value
or key that represents the original string. Hashing is used to index and retrieve items in a
 database because it is faster to find the item using the shorter hashed key than to find it
 using the original value. It is also used in many encryption algorithms.
+++
A hash function is any well-defined procedure or mathematical function which converts a large,
possibly variable-sized amount of data into a small datum, usually a single integer that may
serve as an index into an array. The values returned by a hash function are called hash values,
hash codes, hash sums, or simply hashes.

transitive closure:
in computer science the concept of transitive closure can be thought of as constructing
a data structure that makes it possible to answer reachability questions [1]. That is,
can one get from node a to node d in one or more hops? A binary relation tells you only
 that node a is connected to node b, and that node b is connected to node c, etc. After
the transitive closure is constructed, as depicted in the following figure, in an O(1)
operation one may determine that node d is reachable from node a. The data structure is
typically stored as a matrix, so if matrix[1][4] = 1, then it is the case that node 1
can reach node 4 through one or more hops.
+++
Transitive closure can be thought of as establishing a data structure that makes
it possible to solve reachability questions (can I get to x from y?) efficiently.
After the preprocessing of constructing the transitive closure, all reachability
queries can be answered in constant time by simply reporting a matrix entry. Transitive
closure is fundamental in propagating the consequences of modified attributes of a graph G.
 For example, consider the graph underlying any spreadsheet model, where the vertices are
cells and there is an edge from cell $i$ to cell j if the result of cell j depends on
cell i. When the value of a given cell is modified, the values of all reachable cells
must also be updated. The identity of these cells is revealed by the transitive closure
of G. Many database problems reduce to computing transitive closures, for analogous reasons.
+++
related to directed graph
+++
Several graph-based algorithms have been proposed in the literature to compute
the transitive closure of a directed graph
+++
transitive closure is a data structure for answering reachability questions:
can I get from point A to point B? usually in the form of a matrix,
e.g., matrix[1][4]=1 means I can go from point 1 to point 4.

or requests to all of them in parallel, and choosing the correct result on the basis of a quorum;
++++
redundancy: Providing multiple identical instances of the same system and switching to one
of the remaining instances in case of a failure (failover);

storage area network (SAN)
is an architecture to attach remote computer storage devices (such as disk arrays, tape libraries,
and optical jukeboxes) to servers in such a way that the devices appear as locally attached to
the operating system.
++++
Network-attached storage (NAS)
vs SAN: uses file-based protocols such as NFS or SMB/CIFS where it is clear that the storage is remote,
and computers request a portion of an abstract file rather than a disk block.
is file-level computer data storage connected to a computer network providing data access to
heterogeneous network clients.
++++
difference
A NAS is a single storage device that operate on data files, while a SAN is a local
 network of multiple devices that operate on disk blocks.
+++
difference
SAN: uses Fibre Channel interconnects (wire), encapsulated SCSI (protocol)
NAS: uses Ethernet and TCP/IP

Java generics
allow "a type or method to operate on objects of various types while providing compile-time type safety
++++
allows the programmer to specify the type that will be accepted by an object.
classic example: collection framework
by default, a collection can accept any object.
generics allows the programmer to create a collection that accepts only
a certain of objects. This allows the compiler to check the type correctness
of the program at compile-time.
+++
allow programmer to specify concrete types to general purpose classes and methods
that operated on Object.
allow you to limit what kind of objects can be inserted into the collection.
+++
Generic programming is a style of computer programming in which algorithms are written
in terms of to-be-specified-later types that are then instantiated when needed for specific
types provided as parameters.
====
allow you to write code that operates on objects whose types have not been determined.
=====
called generics in Java and C#, template in C++, parameterized type by gang of four.
+++
type erasure:
When a generic type is instantiated, the compiler translates those types by a technique called
type erasure  a process where the compiler removes all information related to type parameters
 and type arguments within a class or method. Type erasure enables Java applications that use
generics to maintain binary compatibility with Java libraries and applications that were
 created before generics.
e.g. ArrayList<String> is translated to ArrayList, which is called the raw type.
raw type: a generic class without any type arguments.
++++
A class is generic if it declares one or more type variables. These type variables are known
as the type parameters of the class.

canonical:
Authoritative or standard; conforming to an accepted rule or procedure.
When referring to programming, canonical means conforming to well-established patterns or rules.
When referring to IP addressing, canonical means the authoritative host name stored

canonicalization
in computer science, canonicalization (abbreviated c14n, where 14 represents the number of letters

bookmarklet
A bookmarklet is an applet, a small computer application, stored as the URL of a bookmark
 in a web browser or as a hyperlink on a web page. The term is a portmanteau of
the terms bookmark and applet. Whether bookmarklet utilities are stored as bookmarks
or hyperlinks, they are designed to add one-click functionality to a browser or web
 page. When clicked, a bookmarklet performs some function, one of a wide variety
such as a search query or data extraction. Usually the applet is a JavaScript program.

Objects In Mirror Are Closer Than They Appear
passenger-side side-view mirror
passenger-side mirrors are convex to allow the drivers to get a wide-angle view of the road
-- behind them and to the sides -- but at the same time, causes objects to appear more distant.
A flat mirror used on driver's side mirrors, on the other hand, would not provide a wider view
of the road.

ODBC
a standard that enables applications to interact with different db. a wrapper around
databases that makes all db behave in a consistent and clearly defined fashion.
It accomplishes this by using s/w drivers that two primary functions. First, they
encapsulate any native db features and hide these from the client. Second, they provide
a common language for interacting with the db.
ODBC client applications do not interact with db directly. Instead, they interact with
ODBC data sources. a data source is logical db that includes the driver (each db type
has its own driver) and info on how to connect to the db.

Wiki is a piece of server software that allows users to freely create and edit
 Web page content using any Web browser. Wiki supports hyperlinks and has a simple
text syntax for creating new pages and crosslinks between internal pages on the fly.
Wiki is unusual among group communication mechanisms in that it allows the
 organization of contributions to be edited in addition to the content itself.

copy-on-write
an optimizing strategy in computer programming. here's how it works.
let's say multiple processes want to access a resource. instead of giving
each process a copy of the resource, you give them a pointer to the same resource.
when one of the processes tries to modify the resource, you create a private copy
for that process. this prevents the changes from becoming visible to everyone else.

shadow paging
a copy-on-write technique for avoiding in-place updates of pages. when a page is to
be modified, a shadow page is allocated. The shadow page is then modified (the
original page is unchanged). when the shadow page is ready to become persistent,
all pages that refer to the original are updated to refer to the new replacement page.

+++
Type 2 (or hosted) hypervisors are software applications running within a conventional
operating-system environment. Considering the hypervisor layer as a distinct software
layer, guest operating systems thus run at the third level above the hardware.

 VMware Fusion, the open source QEMU, Microsoft Virtual PC and Microsoft Virtual Server products,

========= cloud computing ==========
cloud computing
The cloud is a metaphor for "the Internet."
cloud computing means using the Internet to provide your programs and store your data.
+++
a general term for anything that involves delivering hosted services over the Internet.
These services are broadly divided into three categories: Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS),
Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS).
+++
A cloud service has three distinct characteristics that differentiate it from traditional
hosting. It is sold on demand, typically by the minute or the hour; it is elastic -- a
user can have as much or as little of a service as they want at any given time; and
the service is fully managed by the provider (the consumer needs nothing but a personal
computer and Internet access).
+++
an elastic, pay per use computing architecture and model
+++
Infrastructure-as-a-Service like Amazon Web Services provides virtual server instances
with unique IP addresses and blocks of storage on demand. Customers use the provider's
application program interface (API) to start, stop, access and configure their virtual
servers and storage
+++
Platform-as-a-service in the cloud is defined as a set of software and product
 development tools hosted on the provider's infrastructure. Developers create
applications on the provider's platform over the Internet. PaaS providers may
use APIs, website portals or gateway software installed on the customer's computer.
 Force.com, (an outgrowth of Salesforce.com) and GoogleApps are examples of PaaS.
+++
In the software-as-a-service cloud model, the vendor supplies the hardware infrastructure,
 the software product and interacts with the user through a front-end portal. SaaS is
a very broad market. Services can be anything from Web-based email to inventory control
and database processing. Because the service provider hosts both the application and
the data, the end user is free to use the service from anywhere.
====
A public cloud is one in which a cloud service provider makes resources such as servers,
 storage, networking and, possibly, applications available to users over the Internet.
example: Amazon's EC2
++
Private clouds take two forms: internal clouds and external private clouds. An internal cloud
is inside your data center (on-premises), giving IT managers complete control over the available resources.
example: Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud and Microsoft Azure are examples of packaged software for creating internal clouds.
+++
External private clouds combine characteristics of internal clouds and public clouds. They are like
 public clouds because they are off-premises. But unlike public clouds, applications run on dedicated
 servers, and the cloud provider has built container walls around the external private cloud to make
it more secure than public clouds. example: Amazon's Virtual Private Cloud
=====
cloud computing (another definition)
Cloud computing is a category of computing solutions in which a technology and/or service lets
users access computing resources on demand, as needed, whether the resources are physical or
virtual, dedicated, or shared, and no matter how they are accessed (via a direct connection,
LAN, WAN, or the Internet). The cloud is often characterized by self-service interfaces that
let customers acquire resources when needed as long as needed.
+++
a computing solution that allows the users to access computing resources on demand
regardless of capacity or duration.
+++++
a way to increase capacity or add capabilities on the fly without investing in new infrastructure,
training new personnel, or licensing new software. Cloud computing encompasses any subscription-based
or pay-per-use service that, in real time over the Internet, extends IT's existing capabilities.
+++
SaaS
This type of cloud computing delivers a single application through the browser to thousands of
customers using a multitenant architecture. On the customer side, it means no upfront investment in
 servers or software licensing; on the provider side, with just one app to maintain, costs are
low compared to conventional hosting.
+++
utility computing
offer storage and virtual servers that IT can access on demand.
+++
Platform-as-a-service
delivers development environments as a service.
You build your own applications that run on the provider's infrastructure and are delivered to your users
via the Internet from the provider's servers.
--> provide a cloud-based application development environment. allow developers to build applications
that run in a cloud.
--> sits between IaaS and SaaS models.

container: a run-time environment for components.

servlet: purpose is to receive HTTP requests, generate dynamic data (usually in HTML),
and delver an HTTP response.
Servlets are pure Java objects that generate HTML by writing it to a stream. The files
do not contain any HTML tags; they simply contain Java code which write out HTML (as strings)
 to produce the page that is sent to the user's browser.

JSP: an HTML page containing embedded java code. an HTML page embedded with java code.

JSPs and servlets are two different ways to accomplish the same goal: generating dynamic HTML pages
 using Java code. One puts Java code in your HTML, and one puts HTML in your Java code.
Functionally, they are equivalent. In fact, under the covers, the web server takes a JSP and
converts it to the corresponding servlet and dynamically compiles it.

JSPs live in an object called a container, which is essentially a server

Design by Contract (DbC) or Programming by Contract is an approach to designing computer
software. It prescribes that software designers should define formal, precise and verifiable
interface specifications for software components, which extend the ordinary definition

+++
preconditions: what must be true when the method is called
postconditions: what must be true after the method completes
class invariant: what must be true about each instance of a class
+++
design by contract says that there are 3 concepts about any piece of code:
preconditions, postconditions, and invariants
+++
precondition: expect a certain condition to be true on entry
postcondition: guarantee a certain condition on exit
invariant: maintain a certain condition

what does the contract expect?
what does the contract guarantee?
what does the contract maintain?

virtual memory
An imaginary memory area supported by some operating systems
in conjunction with the hardware. You can think of virtual memory as an alternate set of
 memory addresses. Programs use these virtual addresses rather than real addresses to store
instructions and data. When the program is actually executed, the virtual addresses are
converted into real memory addresses.
The purpose of virtual memory is to enlarge the address space, the set of addresses a program
 can utilize. For example, virtual memory might contain twice as many addresses as main memory.
 A program using all of virtual memory, therefore, would not be able to fit in main memory all
 at once. Nevertheless, the computer could execute such a program by copying into main memory
those portions of the program needed at any given point during execution.
To facilitate copying virtual memory into real memory, the operating system divides virtual
 memory into pages, each of which contains a fixed number of addresses. Each page is stored
on a disk until it is needed. When the page is needed, the operating system copies it from

equation of time
The difference in time between what your watch reads and the position of the sun
(clock time vs. sun time) is called the Equation-of-Time. If you are in the northern
 hemisphere and the sun's position is to the east of where your watch indicates it
would be, the Equation-of-Time is negative. If the sun is to the west, the Equation-of-Time is positive.

push model. data is pushed to the application.
When you use a SAX parser you pass a handler object to the SAX parser. This handler
object has a method for every "event" you want to handle, during the traversal of the XML document.

test fixture
A test fixture is something used to consistently test some item, device, or piece of software.
a test fixture is all the things that must be in place in order to run a test and expect a particular outcome.
frequently fixtures are created by handling setUp() and tearDown()  events of the unit testing framework. In setUp()  one would create the expected state for the test, and in tearDown()  it would clean up what had been set up.

Four phases of a test:
   1. Set up -- Setting up the test fixture.
   2. Exercise -- Interact with the system under test.
   3. Verify -- Determine whether the expected outcome has been obtained.
   4. Tear down -- Tear down the test fixture to return to the original state.

Class of service (CoS):
is a way of managing traffic in a network by grouping similar types of traffic
(for example, e-mail, streaming video, voice, large document file transfer) together
 and treating each type as a class with its own level of service priority. Unlike Quality
of Service (QoS) traffic management, Class of Service technologies do not guarantee a level
 of service in terms of bandwidth and delivery time; they offer a "best-effort." On the other
hand, CoS technology is simpler to manage and more scalable as a network grows in structure
 and traffic volume. One can think of CoS as "coarsely-grained" traffic control and QoS as
 "finely-grained" traffic control.
+++++++++++
a form of priority queuing that has been used in a number of communication and networking protocols.
It is a way of classifying and prioritizing packets based on application type
++++
CoS is a queuing discipline while QoS covers a wider range of techniques to manage bandwidth and network resources.
+++
As an analogy, CoS is like classifying packages for delivery via regular mail, second-day delivery,
or next-day delivery. QoS is what the delivery company does to ensure your packages are delivered
on time (such as package tracking, air transport, door-to-door pickup and drop-off).

coupling: the degree to which a module depends on another module.
cohesion: a measure of how strongly-related or focused the responsibilities of a single module are

Good cohesion is desired within object-oriented programming so that each class has a well defined purpose and therefore contains the variables and methods necessary to fulfill that purpose.
low coupling often correlates with high cohesion

each: execute a block of code for each element of a list
map: apply a function to each element of a list and return a new list of the same size.
reduce/fold: combine all the elements of a list using a function and return a single value.

MapReduce
from lisp:
map:
let's say we have a square function: square(x) = x*x

calling map square [1,2,3,4,5] will return [1,4,9,16,25], as map will go through the
 list, and apply the function square to each element.

reduce/fold:
folding of the list [1,2,3,4,5] with the addition operator would result in 15, the
 sum of the elements of the list [1,2,3,4,5]

In Lisp, a map takes as input a function and a sequence of values. It then applies
 the function to each value in the sequence. A reduce combines all the elements of a
sequence using a binary operation. For example, it can use "+" to add up all the elements in the sequence.

mapreduce of google:

map: takes an input pair and produces a set of intermediate key/value pairs.
reduce: accepts an intermediate key and a set of values for that key. It merges together these
 values to form a possibly smaller set of values.
---
All values with the same key are presented to a single reduce task.

e.g.
consider the problem of counting the number of occurrences of each word in a large collection of documents:

map(String key, String value):
// key: document name
// value: document contents
for each word w in value:
  EmitIntermediate(w, "1");

reduce(String key, Iterator values):
// key: a word
// values: a list of counts
int result = 0;
for each v in values:
  result += ParseInt(v);
Emit(AsString(result));

--more:
there is a intermediate (shuffle) step between map and reduce where the output of map is grouped by key;
--example:
map emits: {'hello': {count:1}}, {'world': {count: 1}}, {'hello': {count: 1}}
shuffle produces:
{'hello': [{count: 1},{count: 1}]) , {'world': [{count:1}])
the output of shuffle goes to reduce
--
Map(k1,v1) → list(k2,v2)
intermediate: list(k2,v2) -> list(k2, list(v2))
Reduce(k2, list (v2)) → list(v3)

The map function emits each word plus an associated count of occurrences ("1" in this example).
 The reduce function sums together all the counts emitted for a particular word.
Here, each document is split in words, and each word is counted initially with a "1" value by the Map
 function, using the word as the result key. The framework puts together all the pairs with the same
 key and feeds them to the same call to Reduce, thus this function just needs to sum all of its
 input values to find the total appearances of that word.

JVM heap: an area of memory used for dynamic memory allocation. divided into 3 generations:
    * The young generation stores short-lived objects that are created and immediately garbage collected.
    * Objects that persist longer are moved to the old generation (also called the tenured generation).
    * The permanent generation (or permgen) is used for class definitions and associated metadata.

page cache / disk cache

problems related to that domain

tactical solution: quick, simple, temporary
strategic solution: complex, need more time, lasting, requires planning

coarse-grained: large loads, efficient, not convenient
fine-grained: small loads, not efficient, convenient

materialized view
the query result is cached  as a concrete table that may be updated from the original base
 tables from time to time. This enables much more efficient access, at the cost of some data
being potentially out-of-date. It is most useful in data warehousing scenarios, where frequent
 queries of the actual base tables can be extremely expensive.
A materialized view is a database object that contains the results of a query. They are local
 copies of data located remotely, or are used to create summary tables based on aggregations
 of a table's data. Materialized views, which store data based on remote tables are also, know as snapshots.
the material view is manifested as a real table.
==> regular view:
a view is a virtual table representing the result of a database query. Whenever an ordinary view's
 table is queried or updated, the DBMS converts these into queries or updates against the underlying
 base tables

 is a notation for representing a fixed value in source code. Almost all programming languages have
 notations for atomic values such as integers, floating-point numbers, strings, and booleans;
 some also have notations for elements of enumerated types and compound values such as arrays, records, and objects.
--> something that represents a fixed value, such as string, integer, boolean, etc in source code

act as an intermediary between your application and the database. They move data back and forth between Java objects and database records.
allow ripple effects from possible changes to the persistence mechanism to be confined to a specific area.

java synchronization
synchronization is required for reliable inter-thread communications as well as for mutual exclusion.
when multiple threads share mutable data, each thread that reads or writes the data must perform
synchronization. Otherwise, there is no guarantee that one thread's changes will be visible to another.

Code refactoring is the process of changing a computer program's source code without modifying its
 external functional behavior in order to improve some of the nonfunctional attributes of the software.

WebSocket is a technology providing for bi-directional, full-duplex communications channels, over
 a single Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) socket, designed to be implemented in web browsers
and web servers but can be utilised by any client or server application.
part of the HTML5 initiative
+++
introduced the WebSocket JavaScript interface, which defines a full-duplex single socket connection
 over which messages can be sent between client and server. The WebSocket standard attempts to
simplify much of the complexity around bi-directional web communication and connection management.
=====
WebSockets represent an alternative to Comet and Ajax.
+++
This specification defines an API that enables Web pages to use the WebSocket protocol for two-way
 communication with a remote host.
++++
provides for full duplex communication between a browser and a server

the original model of the web, in which a browser requests a complete web page at a time.
++++++
Comet is a web application model in which a long-held HTTP request allows a web server to push data to a browser, without the browser explicitly requesting it.
The use of Comet techniques predates the name Comet, and is also known by several other names,
 including Ajax Push, Reverse Ajax, Two-way-web, HTTP Streaming, and HTTP server push

Push technology, or server push, describes a style of Internet-based communication where the request
 for a given transaction is initiated by the publisher or central server.
It is contrasted with pull technology, where the request for the transmission of information is
 initiated by the receiver or client.

duck typing
the type of an object is defined by what it can do
This method of not caring about the actual type of a variable, just relying on what methods
 it supports is known as Duck Typing.

edge case
a problem or situation that occurs only at an extreme (maximum or minimum) operating parameter.

boundary case is frequently used in software engineering  to refer to the behavior of a system when
 one of its inputs is at or just beyond its maximum or minimum limits. It is frequently used when
discussing software testing.
For example, if an input field is meant to accept only integer values 0 - 100, entering the
 values -1, 0, 100, and 101 would represent the boundary cases.
=====
It is commonly thought that three cases should be used when boundary testing (one on the boundary,
 and one on either side to it). However, the case on the valid side of the boundary is redundant,
 and so equivalence partitioning recommends skipping it.

corner case (or pathological case) is a problem or situation that occurs only outside of normal
 operating parameters   specifically one that manifests itself when multiple environmental
variables or conditions are simultaneously at extreme levels, even though each parameter is
within the specified range for that parameter.
+++
Contrast a corner case with an edge case, an issue that occurs only at a (single) maximum or
 minimum parameter. For example, a speaker that distorts audio at maximum volume, even in
the absence of other extreme settings or conditions.
===
edge case: extreme situations that challenge the system

Behavior driven development (or BDD) is an agile software development technique that encourages
 collaboration between developers, QA and non-technical or business participants in a software project.
++
BDD focuses on obtaining a clear understanding of desired software behaviour through discussion
 with stakeholders. It extends TDD by writing test cases in a natural language that non-programmers can read.

N+1 select problem
let's say you have a collection of persons and you want to get the address of each person.
first, you get all the persons: select name from person_table;
then for each person, you get an address: select address from address_table where person_name = ?
hence N+1
solution: use joins
select person_table.name, address_table.address
    from person_table left join address_table on (person_table.name = address_table.person_name);

Fermi problem, Fermi estimate
is an estimation problem designed to teach dimensional analysis, approximation, and the importance of clearly identifying one's assumptions
such problems typically involve making justified guesses about quantities that seem impossible to compute given limited available information.
e.g "How many piano tuners are there in Chicago?

Fermi paradox is the apparent contradiction between high estimates of the probability of the
 existence of extraterrestrial civilizations and the lack of evidence for, or contact with, such civilizations.

wire protocol
refers to a way of getting data from point to point: A wire protocol is needed if more than one application
has to interoperate.
the mechanism for transmitting data from point a to point b
===
In a network, it is the mechanism for transmitting data from point a to point b. It often refers
to a distributed object protocol such as SOAP, CORBA or RMI, which is software only and which
 invokes the running of programs on remote servers.
===
The term is a bit confusing, because it sounds like the physical layer (layer 1) of the network
 that places the bits "onto the wire." In some cases, it may refer to this layer; however, it
generally refers to protocols higher than the physical layer or even the next higher data link
layer (layer 2) such as Ethernet and ATM.

examples of wire protocols are
    * IIOP for CORBA
    * JRMP for RMI
    * SOAP for Web Services

In shipping, breakbulk cargo or general cargo is a term that covers a great variety of goods
 that must be loaded individually, and not in intermodal containers nor in bulk as with oil or grain.

Bulk cargo is commodity cargo that is transported unpackaged in large quantities. This cargo
is usually dropped or poured, with a spout or shovel bucket, as a liquid or as a mass of
 relatively small solids (e.g. grain, coal), into a bulk carrier ship's hold, railroad car,
or tanker truck/trailer/semi-trailer body. Smaller quantities (still considered "bulk") can
 be boxed (or drummed) and palletised. Bulk cargo is classified as liquid or dry.

POSIX

An embeddable object cannot be directly persisted, or queried, it can only be persisted or queried in the context of its parent. An embeddable object does not have an id or table.

JPA Orphan removal will ensure that any object no longer referenced from the sourceis deleted
 from the database.

JPA cascading : allows the relationship to be cascaded
If persist() is called on the parent, and the child is also new, it will also be persisted.
used in one-to-one and one-to-many relationships
cascade options: persist, remove, merge, refresh, all
e.g. relationship: Order -> OrderLine.
Cascading the orderLines relationship allows for the Order's -> OrderLines to be persisted,
 removed, merged along with their parent.

bean-managed transaction
the code in the session or message-driven bean explicitly marks the boundaries of the transaction.
 An entity bean cannot have bean-managed transactions; it must use container-managed transactions
instead. Although beans with container-managed transactions require less coding, they have one
limitation: When a method is executing, it can be associated with either a single transaction
 or no transaction at all. If this limitation will make coding your bean difficult, you should
 consider using bean-managed transactions.

Container-Managed Transactions
the EJB container sets the boundaries of the transactions.

JMX : Java Management Extensions
MBean: a java object representing a resource to be managed.
its interface consists of:
	attributes that can be read and written
	operations that can be invoked
	notifications that can be emitted by the MBean

EclipseLink:
session: the facade through which an application accesses EclipseLink functionality
An EclipseLink session provides the primary access to the EclipseLink runtime. It is the means
 by which your application performs all persistence operations with the data source that contains
 persistent objects.

EAV
Conceptually an EAV design involves a single table with three columns, an entity (such as an
olfactory receptor ID), an attribute (such as species, which is actually a pointer into the
 metadata table) and a value for the attribute (e.g., rat). In EAV design, one row stores
 a single fact. In a conventional table that has one column per attribute, by contrast,
 one row stores a set of facts. EAV design is appropriate when the number of parameters
 that potentially apply to an entity is vastly more than those that actually apply to an individual entity.
+++
appropriate when the number of possible attributes is much greater than the number
that will actually apply to a given entity

out-of-band:
In software, describes values of a function which are not in its natural
 range of return values, but are rather signals that some kind of exception has occurred.
 Many C functions, for example, return a nonnegative integral value, but indicate failure
 with an out-of-band return value of -1.

turing machine: An abstract device that can simulate the logic of any conceivable computer algorithm
A programming language that is capable of modeling any possible computation algorithm is said to
be "Turing complete." it could be used to solve any computation problem.

Prototype-based programming is a style of object-oriented programming in which classes
 are not present, and behavior reuse (known as inheritance in class-based languages) is
performed via a process of cloning existing objects that serve as prototypes. This model
 can also be known as classless, prototype-oriented or instance-based programming.
 Delegation is the language feature that supports prototype-based programming.

JSONP: JSON with padding

An exception is the HTML <script> element. Exploiting the open policy for <script> elements,
 some pages use them to retrieve JavaScript code that operates on dynamically generated
JSON-formatted data from other origins. This usage pattern is known as JSONP. Requests

CSS sprite:
To reduce the number of requests the browser makes to the server, some web designers combine
 numerous small images or icons into a larger image called a sprite sheet.
 CSS is used to display the parts of the composite image to display at different points
in the page. If a page has 10 1 kB images, they can be combined into one 10 kB image,
 downloaded with a single HTTP request, and then positioned with CSS. Reducing the number
 of HTTP requests can make a Web page load much faster.

behind the retina. The end result being distant objects are seen more clearly than near objects.

astigmatism: a vision problem where light rays entering the eye are focused on two points
because the cornea is irregularly (not spherically) shaped. The end result is blurry images.

solar calendar: a calendar whose dates indicate the position of the earth in its orbit
around the sun. If the dates indicate season, it is called tropical solar calendar
(Gregorian calendar).
If the position of the earth is reckoned with respect to the fixed stars, it is
called sidereal solar calendar (Hindu Solar calendar).

ecliptic: the apparent path of the sun as seen from the earth.
If the sun's path is observed from the Earth's reference frame, it appears
 to move around the Earth in a path which is tilted with respect to the spin
 axis at 23.5. This path is called the ecliptic.
---> the sun's path in the sky

ecliptic plane: the plane that contains the orbit of the earth.

celestial sphere: an imaginary sphere of infinite radius concentric with
the earth. on which
all celestial bodies except the Earth are imagined to be projected.
+++
The stars can be imagined to be points of light on a sphere which rotates about the Earth.
 Projecting the Earth's poles and equator out onto this imaginary sphere provides a
 framework for celestial measurement.

The length of a day, which is measured by the time it takes Earth to rotate once on its axis.

mean solar day: the average period of rotation of the earth about its axis
with respect to the sun. defined to be 24 hours.

sidereal day: the period of rotation of the earth about its axis with
respect to the stars.

The celestial equator is a great circle on the imaginary celestial sphere,
 which is actually the plane of the terrestrial equator extended out into
the universe (i.e., it could be constructed by extrapolating the Earth's
equator until it touches the celestial sphere).
the projection of the geographical equator upon the celestial sphere.

great circle: a circle on the surface of a sphere that has
the same circumference as the sphere. a circle on the surface
of a sphere such that the plane containing the circle passes
through the center of the sphere.

the equivalent of latitude: declination
the equivalent of longitude: right ascension (measured in hours, minutes, seconds).
one hour = 15 degrees

Using the celestial sphere as a reference is called sidereal time.
Solar (tropical) time: use the sun as a reference.

tropical year: the length of time that the sun, as viewed from the earth, takes to return
to the same position along the ecliptic. The precise length of time depends on which
point of the ecliptic one chooses.
The time from one fixed point, such as a solstice or equinox,
to the next is called a tropical year (this is a generalization)

The time from one new moon to the next is called a synodic month.

19 years is called a Metonic cycle. 19 tropical years is about 235 synodic months.
Every 19 years, the phases of the moon fall on the same dates.

lunisolar calendar: a calendar whose dates indicate both the moon phase and the time of
the solar year. If the solar year is defined as a tropical year then a lunisolar
calendar will give an indication of the season.
the year coincides with the tropical year and the month coincides with the synodic month.

Chinese calendar: based on a combination of lunar and solar movements.
The lunar cycle is roughly 29.5 days.
Every few years, the lunar calendar is synchronized with the solar year
by adding an extra month.

intercalation: solar year does not have whole number of days. a calendar year must
have a whole number of days. To reconcile the two, one must vary the number of days
in a year. In gregorian calendar, the intercalary day is Feb 29. The solar year does
not have a whole number of months either, so lunisolar calendar must have a variable
number of months in a year.

A constellation is any one of the 88 areas into which the sky  or the celestial sphere  is divided.

The term zodiac denotes an annual cycle of twelve stations along the ecliptic,
the apparent path of the sun across the heavens through the constellations

valence shell: the outermost electron shells.
free radical: has an unpaired electron in the valence shell. highly reactive.
oxidize: to lose an electron
oxidant (oxidizing agent): tends to oxidize other substances (i.e., steal electrons from other substances)
	A substance that gains electrons in a redox chemical reaction.
reduce: to gain an electron

oxidation is better defined as an increase in oxidation number, and reduction as a decrease in oxidation number.

Substances that have the ability to oxidize other substances are said to be oxidative
and are known as oxidizing agents, oxidants or oxidizers. Put another way, the oxidant
 removes electrons from another substance, and is thus reduced itself. And because
it "accepts" electrons it is also called an electron acceptor.

Substances that have the ability to reduce other substances are said to be reductive
and are known as reducing agents, reductants, or reducers. Put in another way, the
reductant transfers electrons to another substance, and is thus oxidized itself.
And because it "donates" electrons it is also called an electron donor.

antioxidant: reduce oxidative damage to cells. donate electrons to free radicals.
An antioxidant is a molecule capable of slowing or preventing the oxidation of other molecules.
Oxidation is a chemical reaction that transfers electrons from a substance to an oxidizing agent.
Oxidation reactions can produce free radicals, which start chain reactions that damage cells.
Antioxidants terminate these chain reactions by removing free radical intermediates, and
inhibit other oxidation reactions by being oxidized themselves. As a result, antioxidants
are often reducing agents such as thiols or polyphenols.

plant cells have walls. cell wall is composed of cellulose, hemicellulose and pectin.
Lignin fills the spaces in the cell wall between cellulose, hemicellulose and pectin components.
Lignin makes wood stiff and trees stand upright
Paper is made from wood, which is made up mainly of white cellulose. Wood also has a lot
of a dark substance in it called lignin, which ends up in the paper, too, along with the
cellulose. The exposure of lignin to air and sunlight is what turns paper yellow.

channel capacity: the amount of information that can be reliably transmitted over a channel.

parallax: An apparent change in the direction of an object, caused by a change
in observational position that provides a new line of sight.

Precession refers to a change in the direction of the axis of a rotating object.

A gyroscope is a device for measuring or maintaining orientation,
based on the principle of conservation of angular momentum. The
essence of the device is a spinning wheel on an axle. The device,
once spinning, tends to resist changes to its orientation due to
the angular momentum of the wheel. In physics this phenomenon is
also known as gyroscopic inertia or rigidity in space.

polymorphism:
In object-oriented programming, the ability of different objects to respond, each in its own way,
to the same message.
types of polymorphism:

(3) parametric polymorphism: java generics, C++ templates, a method that can accept any type.
     used a lot in functional programming.
(4) subtype/inclusion polymorphism

An objects class defines how the object is implemented.
In contrast, an objects type only refers to its interface.
Class inheritance defines an objects implementation in terms of another objects implementation.
Type inheritance describes when an object can be used in place of another
Inheritance: a language feature that allows you to derive a new class from an existing class.
inheritance: object types are organized in a class hierarchy.

encapsulation:
The localization of knowledge within a module. Because objects encapsulate data and
implementation, the user of an object can view the object as a black box that provides services.
Programming technique that hides the implementation of an operation from its users behind
an abstract interface. This allows the implementation to be updated or changed without
 impacting the users of the interface.
--- data and behavior are package together.

default:
A particular setting or value for a variable that is assigned automatically
 by an operating system and remains in effect unless canceled or overridden by the operator.
A situation or condition that obtains in the absence of active intervention

Modeling is a central part of all the activities that
lead up to the deployment of good software. We
build models to communicate the desired structure and
behavior of our system. We build models to visualize
and control the system's architecture. We build models
to better understand the system we are building, often
exposing opportunities for simplification and reuse.
And we build models to manage risk.

a model is a simplification of reality.
--
modeling is the representation of reality in an abstract way.

principles of modeling:
1. The choice of what models to create has a profound influence
 on how a problem is attacked and how a solution is shaped.
2. Every model may be expressed at different levels of precision.
3. The best models are connected to reality.
4. No single model or view is sufficient. Every nontrivial
system is best approached through a small set of nearly
independent models with multiple viewpoints.

aims:
1. Models help us to visualize a system as it is or as we want it to be.
2. Models permit us to specify the structure or behavior of a system.
3. Models give us a template that guides us in constructing a system.
4. Models document the decisions we have made.

We build models of complex systems because we cannot comprehend such a system in its entirety.

To understand the architecture of such a system, you need
several complementary and interlocking views: a use case
 view (exposing the requirements of the system), a design
 view (capturing the vocabulary of the problem space and
the solution space), an interaction view (showing the
 interactions among the parts of the system and between
 the system and the environment), an implementation view
 (addressing the physical realization of the system), and
 a deployment view (focusing on system engineering issues).
 Each of these views may have structural, as well as
 behavioral, aspects. Together, these views represent
the blueprints of software.

model: an interpretation of reality that abstracts the aspects relevant
to solving the problem at hand and ignores extraneous details.

Systems design is the process or art of defining the hardware
 and software architecture, components, modules, interfaces,
and data for a computer system to satisfy specified requirements.

Abstraction is the process of reducing the information
content of a concept, or of an observation of an empirical
 phenomenon, typically in order to retain only information
which is relevant for a particular purpose. For example,
abstracting a leather soccer ball to a ball retains only
the information on general ball attributes and behaviour.
 Similarly, abstracting happiness to an emotional state
reduces the amount of information conveyed about the emotional state.
---
is the elimination of the irrelevant and the amplification of the essential.

An abstraction layer is a way of hiding the implementation details of a particular set of functionality.

----
omitting certain kinds of detail in order to emphasise others
"The ability to simplify means to eliminate the unnecessary so that the necessary may speak"

aggregation: composite aggregation vs shared aggregation
composition: the part cannot exist on its own

Systems analysis is the science dealing with analysis of
complex, large scale systems and the interactions within those systems.

A business analyst (BA) is responsible for analyzing the business
 needs of their clients and stakeholders to help identify business
problems and propose solutions. Within the systems
 development life cycle domain, the BA typically performs
a liaison function between the business side of an enterprise
and the information technology department or external service providers.

Requirements analysis encompasses all of the tasks that
go into the instigation, scoping and definition of a new or altered system.
Identify the needs or requirements of a client.

Popular architectural styles are often a product of the weaknesses of their predecessors.

OEM: are manufacturers who resell another company's product under
their own name and branding.
While an OEM is similar to a VAR (value-added reseller),
it refers specifically to the act of a company rebranding
 a product to its own name and offering its own warranty,
support and licensing of the product. The term is really
a misnomer because OEMs are not the original manufacturers;
they are the customizers.
OEM was an adjective used to describe a company that produced
 hardware to be marketed under another company's brand

VAR: typically load applications or proprietary software
onto computers and may also incorporate third-party options
to design a complete solution for a client. This "value-added"
system is often customized for a specific application, but
is sold to the VAR's customer base under the original design
 manufacturer brand; with that manufacturer's warranty,
 support, and license agreements.

holding company: Company formed for the purpose of owning or controlling other companies.

c/o: care of: Through someone, by way of someone, as in I sent the gift

organic growth: A company is said to be growing organically when it is
increasing the turnover of its existing business.
Contrast this with a company that is growing by acquiring other companies.
The growth rate that a company can achieve by increasing output
and enhancing sales. This excludes any profits or growth
acquired from takeovers, acquisitions or mergers. Takeovers,
 acquisitions and mergers do not bring about profits generated
 within the company, and therefore, are not considered organic.
Organic growth represents the true growth for the core of the company.
 It is a good indicator of how well management has used its internal
 resources to expand profits. Organic growth also identifies whether
managers have used their skills to improve the business.

URL: a unique address for a file on the internet. URL is a type of URI.
URN: urn:<namespace identifier (NID)>:<namespace specific string (NSS)>
An URI locator is known as URL.

serialization: The process of converting the data in an object to XML (or byte stream)
is called serialization. The reverse of serialization, loading XML into the object,
is called deserialization.

Curb weight is the total weight of an automobile with standard equipment,
motor oil, coolant, a full tank of fuel and not loaded with either passengers or cargo.

A gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) is the maximum allowable total weight

Impedance matching is the practice of attempting to make the output impedance
of a source equal to the input impedance of the load to which it is ultimately
connected, usually in order to maximise the power transfer and minimise reflections from the load.

Impedance mismatch is a term in systems analysis which describes
an inadequate or excessive ability of one system to accommodate
input from another.

Object-relational impedance mismatch: refers to the difficulty in
mapping tables in the relational database to an object model.

severability: If any part of this agreement is legally declared invalid
or unenforceable, all other parts of this agreement are still valid and enforceable.

law of demeter: principle of least knowledge. a design guideline for software
development, particularly OO. "Talk to your immediate friends". a given object
should assume as little as possible about the structure and properties of other
objects.

QoS:
a networking term that specifies a guaranteed throughput level.
---
In the fields of packet-switched networks and computer networking,
the traffic engineering term Quality of Service (QoS) refers to control
 mechanisms that can provide different priority to different users or
 data flows, or guarantee a certain level of performance to a data
 flow in accordance with requests from the application program.
The term Quality of Service is sometimes used as a quality
measure with many alternative definitions.
The goal of QoS is to provide guarantees on the ability of a network to deliver predictable results.
Elements of network performance within the scope of QoS often
include availability (uptime), bandwidth (throughput), latency (delay), and error rate.
QoS involves prioritization of network traffic.
QoS: provides guaranteed timely delivery of specific application data or resources
 to a particular destination or destinations.

Bandwidth in computer networking refers to the data rate supported by a network connection or interface.
Bandwidth represents the capacity of the connection
the capacity of a communications channel.

throughput: Output or production, as of a computer program, over a period of time.
In communication networks, such as Ethernet or packet radio, throughput is the average rate of
successful message delivery over a communication channel. usually in bits per second

SOAP performance:
    * Extracting the SOAP envelope from the SOAP packet is time-expensive.
    * Parsing the contained XML information in the SOAP envelope using a XML parser is also time-expensive.
    * There is not much optimization possible with XML data.
    * SOAP encoding rules make it mandatory to include typing information in all
	the SOAP messages sent and received.
    * Encoding binary data in a form acceptable to XML results in overhead of
	additional bytes added as a result of the encoding as well as processor
	 overhead performing the encoding/decoding.

prolepsis: The anticipation and answering of an objection or argument before one's opponent has put it forward.

gregorian calendar: Years in the calendar are numbered from the traditional birth year of Jesus.
named after Pope Gregory XIII. Decreed in 1582. By that time, spring equinox was on Mar 10. Skipped
ten days in 1582. Adopted by UK in 1752 (skipped 11 days). motivated by the calculation of the date
of Easter (the first sunday after the first full moon on or after the spring equinox). repeat
every 400 years. 97 leap years in 400 years. Julian calendar has 100 leap years in 400 years.
Leap years are all years divisible by 4, with the exception of those divisible by 100, but not by 400.

Anno Domini: latin: in the year of our lord.

The Common Era, also known as the Current Era, is the period of measured time beginning with the year 1 on the Gregorian calendar.

equinox: the equinox happens when the Sun is at one of two opposite points on
the celestial sphere where the celestial equator and ecliptic intersect.
In a wider sense, the equinoxes are the two days each year when the center
 of the Sun spends an equal amount of time above and below the horizon at every location on Earth.
The sun is directly above the equator at equinox.
Visualization: there is a location on the surface of the earth where the sun
reaches an altitude of 90 degree. This location moves from north to south
and then back. At equinox, this location is on the equator. At solstice, this
location reaches its most northerly/southerly latitude.
On the day of an equinox, the geometric center of the Sun's disk crosses the equator.

dawn: the beginning of morning twilight.
sunrise: is the instant at which the upper edge of the Sun appears above the horizon in the east.
dusk: the end of evening twilight.
sunset: the moment the trailing edge of the sun's disk disappears below the horizon in the west.
twilight: the time between dawn and sunrise, and the time between sunset and dusk.

tropic of cancer: It is the farthest northern latitude at which the sun can
appear directly overhead at noon, an event which occurs on the June solstice.
It is difficult to specify an exact location for both tropic circles because
the obliquity of the ecliptic varies between 22.5 and 24.5 with a 41,000 year periodicity.

The northern solstice is in June on Earth, when the sun is directly over the Tropic of Cancer in the Northern Hemisphere,

"Never increase, beyond what is necessary, the number of entities required to explain anything"
--- William of Ockham (1285-1349)
Occam's razor:
In other words, when multiple competing theories are equal in other respects, the
 principle recommends selecting the theory that introduces the fewest assumptions
and postulates the fewest hypothetical entities.
"when you have two competing theories which make exactly the same predictions, the one that is simpler is the better."

Aesthetics (also spelled esthetics) is a branch of philosophy called value theory or
axiology, which is the study of sensory or sensori-emotional values,
 sometimes called judgments of sentiment and taste.

Camp is an aesthetic in which something has appeal because of its bad taste or ironic value.
Something that is amusing by virtue of its being

public key cryptography:
sender uses recipient's public key to encrypt the message.
recipient uses recipient's private key to decrypt the message.

digital signature: sender encrypts the message using his private key.
Digital signature schemes normally give two algorithms, one for signing which involves the user's
secret or private key, and one for verifying signatures which involves the user's public key.
 The output of the signature process is called the "digital signature."
signing: sender encrypt using sender's private key.
verifying: recipient uses sender's public key.
digital signature: lets the recipient of information verify the information's
origin, and also verify that the information was not tampered with.

In mathematics, a transcendental number is a real or complex number which is not algebraic,
that is, not a solution of a non-zero polynomial equation, with rational coefficients.

real number: include rational (can be expressed as a fraction) and irrational
(cannot be expressed as a fraction) numbers.

complex number: include the imaginary number (square root of -1)

The phrase "Pot calling the kettle black" is an idiom, used to accuse another
speaker of hypocrisy, in that the speaker disparages the subject in a way that
 could equally be applied to him or her. In former times cast iron pots and
 kettles were quickly blackened from the soot of the fire. If personified
into animate objects, the pot would then be hypocritical to insult the
 kettle's colour. The phrase "It takes one to know one" has a similar meaning.

Hypocrisy is the act of condemning another person, when the critic is guilty of the same
thing that is being condemned.

political action committee, is the name commonly given to a private group organized to elect or
defeat government officials in order to promote legislation, often supporting the group's special interests.
A group organized to raise money for their favorite political candidates.

Being carbon neutral, or carbon neutrality, refers to the practice of balancing carbon dioxide
released into the atmosphere from burning fossil fuels, wood, or other sources; with practices
that remove or sequestor carbon from the atmosphere, and use of renewable energy that creates
a similar amount of useful energy without releasing carbon, so that the net carbon emissions are zero.
(carbon offset)

Carbon offsetting is the act of reducing ("offsetting") greenhouse gas emissions.
A well-known example is the planting of trees to compensate for the
greenhouse gas emissions from personal air travel. The idea of paying
 for emission-reductions elsewhere instead of reducing by own actions
is also known from the closely related concept of emissions trading.

carbon footprint: a measure of the impact human activities have on the environment, in terms
of the amount of carbon dioxide produced. A measure of the amount of CO2 emitted
through the combustion of fossil fuels; in the case of an individual, as part of
their daily lives.

The earth's rotation is slowing due to tidal deceleration (gravitational pull from the moon).
The rotation increases due to melting glaciers (water flows from high elevation to low
elevation). The net result is still a decrease in rotational speed.

Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) is a high-precision atomic time standard.
Leap seconds are added to or subtracted from UTC to keep it within 0.9 seconds of UT1.

Universal Time (UT) is a timescale based on the rotation of the Earth. It is
a modern continuation of the Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), i.e., the mean solar time
 on the meridian of Greenwich, England, which is the conventional 0-meridian for
 geographic longitude. GMT is sometimes used, incorrectly, as a synonym for UTC.
The old GMT has been split, in effect, into UTC and UT1.

Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) is a term originally referring to mean solar time
at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich in England. It is now often used to refer
to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) when this is viewed as a time zone,
although strictly UTC is an atomic time scale which only approximates GMT
in the old sense. It is also used to refer to Universal Time (UT), which is the
astronomical concept that directly replaced the original GMT.

Solar time is based on the idea that when the sun reaches its highest point in the sky, it is noon.
The time measured by Earth's rotation relative to the Sun.
a reckoning of the passage of time based on the sun's position in the sky.

Apparent solar time is based on the apparent solar day, which is the interval between two
successive returns of the Sun to the local meridian. Solar time can be measured by a sundial.
Apparent solar time (or true or real solar time) is the time indicated by the Sun on a sundial,
while mean solar time is the average as indicated by clocks.
The average time taken for the sun to return to its highest point is 24 hours.
apparent solar day: the time interval between successive passages of the sun over a local
meridian: not constant because of earth's axial tilt and elliptical shape of earth's orbit.

Mean solar time is artificial clock time adjusted via observations of the diurnal rotation
of the fixed stars to agree with average apparent solar time. The length of a mean solar
 day is a constant 24 hours throughout the year. A time based on a hypothetical sun
moving uniformly along the celestial equator.
Mean solar time, kept by most clocks and watches, is the solar time that
would be measured by observation if the Sun traveled at a uniform apparent speed throughout the year.
To  remedy  the  situation  created  by  apparent  solar  time,  mean  solar  time was
 introduced.  Mean  solar  time  is  based  on  a  fictional  Sun  that
is considered to move at a constant rate of 360 in 24 hours along the celestial  meridian.
 One  mean  day  is  24  hours  in  length,  each  hour consisting of 60 minutes,
and each minute consisting of 60 seconds.

mean sun : an imaginary sun moving uniformly along the celestial equator.

The equation of time is the difference, over the course of a year, between time as read from a sundial and a clock.
The difference between apparent solar time and mean solar time.
The sundial can be ahead (fast) by as much as 16 min 33 s (around November 3)
or fall behind by as much as 14 min 6 s (around February 12).

TAI: international atomic time. not adjusted for leap seconds.
initially, in 1972: TAI - UTC = 10 seconds
as of 2007, total # of leap seconds: 23
	therefore, TAI - UTC = 33 seconds
TAI = UT1 on jan 1 1958
as of 2013: TAI - UTC = 35 seconds

SI second is based on the transition between two energy states in caesium atoms.
defined as a certain number of atomic vibrations.
The SI second that is counted by atomic time standards is currently defined
in such a way that its length matches the nominal second of 1/86400 of a mean solar day between 1750 and 1892.

Cross-sell is a marketing term for the practice of suggesting related products
or services to a customer who is considering buying something. (e.g., would you like fries with that?)

Up-sell is a marketing term for the practice of suggesting higher priced products or
 services to a customer who is considering a purchase. (e.g., Would you like to biggie-size that?")

loose coupling: means a reduction in assumptions between components.

In computer science, a reference is an object containing information which refers to
 data stored elsewhere, as opposed to containing the data itself. Accessing the
value referred to by a reference is called dereferencing it.
More generally, a reference can be considered as a piece of data that allows
unique retrieval of another piece of data.
A reference may be compared to the address of a house. It is a small identifier
 from which it is possible to find a potentially much larger object.
Finding a house based on its address is analogous to dereferencing a reference.
Dereference a pointer.

32-bit: Most CPUs are currently (as of 2005) designed so that the contents of
a single integer register can store the address (location) of any datum in
the computer's virtual memory. Therefore, the total number of addresses
in the virtual memory  the total amount of data the computer can keep
in its working area  is determined by the width of these registers.
32-bit --> 4G of memory.

load balancer: A load balancer can be used to increase the capacity of a server
 farm beyond that of a single server. It can also allow the service to
continue even in the face of server down time due to server failure or server maintenance.
A load balancer consists of a virtual server (also referred to as vserver or VIP) which,
in turn, consists of an IP address and port. This virtual server is bound to a number
 of physical services running on the physical servers in a server farm. These physical
 services contain the physical server's IP address and port. A client sends a request
 to the virtual server, which in turn selects a physical server in the server farm
and directs this request to the selected physical server. Load balancers are sometimes referred to as "directors"

A QAM tuner is a device present in some digital televisions and similar
devices which enables direct reception of digital cable channels without
 the use of a set-top box. QAM stands for "quadrature amplitude modulation,"
the format by which digital cable channels are encoded and transmitted via
 cable. QAM tuners can be likened to the cable equivalent of an ATSC tuner
 which is required to receive over-the-air (OTA) digital channels broadcast
 by local television stations.
Most cable companies don't encrypt the digital signals that they pick up from local broadcasters.

SDTV: 480i, or 525i (When they broadcast video information, they need
to give CRT-type TVs time to reset the electronic beam to the top
of the screen so it can get ready to paint the next sequence of
lines. So they build in an interframe gap that equals about 45
lines. There is no picture information in this 45 line gap it
is there just to allow the TV time to get ready to receive the next frame).
30 frames per second. 1/60 second in one pass.

EDTV: 480p, or 525p

HDTV: 1080i and 720p

ATSC: used to receive HD signals over the air.

The biggest difference between HDTV signals on a cable system and those
 broadcast over the air revolves around the system used to modulate an
 HDTV signal for transmission as radio-frequency signals across the cable system.
HD signals are modulated for transmission.
Broadcast HDTV uses a system called 8-VSB (vestigial sideband), while cable
usually uses a system called QAM (quadrature amplitude modulation).

For a lot of people, HDTV cable service comes through an HDTV set-top box
(or cable box) that has a built-in QAM tuner.
the channels are also encrypted (scrambled)

In some cable systems, the local broadcast HDTV channels are transmitted across the cable system unencrypted.

*  TVs are being built as digital-cable-ready(DCR) - just as regular analog TVs have been built as
cable-ready for analog cable for years. These DCR TVs have a QAM tuner built-in and a slot for a
"smart card" called the CableCARD.

* Some cable companies rent these CableCARDs to their customers. A customer
 with a CableCARD and a DCR HDTV can simply plug the CableCARD into the HDTV -
the card basically gives your TV "permission" to unscramble encrypted premium channels.

modulation is the process of varying a periodic waveform, i.e. a tone, in order to use that signal to convey a message.

tuner
A tuner is a circuit module or free-standing equipment which detects radio-frequency (RF)
signals usually of low amplitude and amplifies them and converts them to a form suitable for further processing.

radio tuner:
receives radio broadcasts and converts them into audio-frequency signals
 which can be fed into an amplifier driving a loudspeaker.

the time it takes light to fly across 400k km to earth.
you see them as they were a billionth of a second earlier.

relativistic aberration: The shape, position or orientation of an object
seen by a person moving near the speed of light can be quite unusual, and
even different to what is predicted by the non-optical aspects of Einstein's
theory of special relativity, such as length contraction. This is due to
the purely visual effects of angular compression and distortion.
Angular compression:
As we travel faster, light appears to come at us from different angles.
as we travel close to the speed of light, the angles of light coming towards us
from all sides appear to contract, such that more light approaches us from in front.
Among other things, this has the effect of allowing a moving observer
 to see behind them. Watch what happens to an arrow originally behind
the green dot as it accelerates. Aberration allows objects which normally
 make an obtuse angle (greater than 90 degrees) with the direction of
 motion to be wrapped forward into the field of view.
Distortion:
 is a visual effect that arises because the speed of light is not infinite,
so light takes some small amount of time to travel a certain distance.
Therefore, light from distant objects must leave earlier in time than
light from closer objects in order for that light to enter an observer's eye at the same time.
When things move at relativistic speeds, however, this effect is noticeable on a
more local scale. This is because in the short time between seeing one part
of an object and another, its enormous speed allows it to move a significant
distance. This has the effect of making objects appear distorted; possible bent,
 curved or twisted. For example, long rods may appear as parabolic arcs
bending away from the viewer, and cubes can present curved edges or
 non-parallel surfaces. Surprisingly, distortion cancels the effect
 of length contraction in the case of a sphere, which will always
 look circular to a moving observer.

pilot: One who, though not belonging to a ship's company, is licensed to conduct a ship into and out of port or through dangerous waters.
  A television program produced as a prototype of a series being considered for adoption by a network.
pilot light: small auxiliary gas burner that provides a flame to ignite a larger gas burner

A hull is the body of a ship or boat.

In boats and ships, keel can refer to either of two parts: a structural element, or a hydrodynamic element.
A structural keel is a large beam which the hull of a ship is built around.
The keel runs in the middle of the ship, from the bow to the stern, and
 serves as the foundation or spine of the structure, providing the
major source of structural strength of the hull.

Displacement is the actual total weight of the vessel. It is often expressed
in long tons or in metric tons, and is calculated simply by multiplying the
volume of the hull below the waterline (ie. the volume of water it is displacing) by the density of the water.
The word "displacement" arises from the basic physical law, discovered by Archimedes,
 that the weight of a floating object equates exactly to that of the water which
 would otherwise occupy the "hole in the water" displaced by the ship.

Lightship measures the actual weight of the ship with no fuel, passengers, cargo, water, etc. on board.

Deadweight (often abbreviated as DWT for deadweight tonnes) is the displacement at any loaded
 condition minus the lightship weight. It includes the crew, passengers, cargo, fuel, water,
 and stores. Like Displacement, it is often expressed in long tons or in metric tons.

Bulk cargo is commodity cargo that is transported unpackaged in large quantities.
These cargos are usually dropped or poured, with a spout or shovel bucket, as a
 liquid or solid, into a bulk carrier's hold, railroad car, or tanker truck/trailer/semi-trailer
 body. Bulk cargos are classified as liquid or dry.
dry bulk cargo: coal, grain, cement
liquid bulk cargo: petroleum, gasoline

A bulk carrier, bulk freighter, or bulker is a merchant ship used to transport
unpackaged bulk cargo such as cereals, coal, ore, and cement.

Roll-on/roll-off (RORO or ro-ro) ships are designed to carry wheeled cargo such as
automobiles, trailers or railroad cars. This is in contrast to lo-lo (lift on-lift off)
vessels which use a crane to load and unload cargo.

The draft (or draught) of a ship's hull is the vertical distance between the waterline and the
bottom of the hull (keel), with the thickness of the hull included

Tonnage is a measure of the size or cargo capacity of a ship (in units of 100 cubic feet.)

Suezmax is a naval architecture term for the largest ships capable of transiting the Suez Canal fully loaded,

Ships classified as Panamax are of the maximum dimensions that will fit through
the locks of the Panama Canal. This size is determined by the dimensions of the
lock chambers, and the depth of the water in the canal.

A lock is a device for raising and lowering boats between stretches of water of
different levels on river and canal waterways. The distinguishing feature of a
lock is a fixed chamber whose water level can be varied; whereas in a caisson
lock, a boat lift, or on a canal inclined plane, it is the chamber itself
that moves, and is then called a caisson

caisson: A watertight structure within which construction work is carried on under water.

culvert: A sewer or drain crossing under a road or embankment.

A pallet (sometimes called a skid) is a flat transport structure designed to support
 a variety of goods in a stable fashion while being lifted by any mobile forklift,
pallet jack, or other jacking device. The goods are placed on top of the pallet,
 and can be secured to it by straps or stretch-wrapped plastic film.

A Trailer is generally an unpowered vehicle pulled by a powered vehicle. Commonly,
the term trailer refers to such vehicles used for transport of goods and materials.

A semi-trailer is a trailer without a front axle. A large proportion of its weight
is supported either by a road tractor or by a detachable front axle assembly known
 as a dolly or by the tail of another trailer.
A road tractor coupled to a semi-trailer is often called a semi-trailer truck or semi.

Intermodal freight transport involves the transportation of freight in a container
 or vehicle, using multiple modes of transportation (rail, ocean vessel, and truck),
without any handling of the freight itself when changing modes.

Exits will be numbered from south to north and west to east. Each exit number is
determined by the number of miles it is from the beginning of a route. For example,
on Interstate 5, exit No. 1 is just north of the Mexican border and Exit 796 is the
off-ramp before the freeway enters Oregon, 796 miles north of the Mexican border.

loaded for bear: ready and eager to deal with something that is going to be difficult

Cognitive dissonance is a psychological term describing the uncomfortable tension
that may result from having two conflicting thoughts at the same time, or from engaging
in behavior that conflicts with one's beliefs.

Electrical impedance, or simply impedance, describes a measure of opposition
to a sinusoidal alternating current (AC). Electrical impedance extends the
concept of resistance to AC circuits, describing not only the relative
amplitudes of the voltage and current, but also the relative phases.

Impedance is the measure of the amount that some object impedes (or obstructs) the
flow of a current. Impedance might refer to resistance, reactance, or some complex combination of the two.

Impedance matching is the practice of attempting to make the output impedance of
a source equal to the input impedance of the load to which it is ultimately connected,
usually in order to maximize the power transfer and minimize reflections from the load.
 This only applies when both are linear devices. The concept of impedance matching was
originally developed for electrical power,

Electrical resistance is a measure of the degree to which an object opposes an electric current through it

object-relational impedance mismatch: refer to the difficulty encountered when mapping
a relation database model to an object model.

physiological processes.

gore point, gore zone: a triangular piece of land found where roads merge or split.

jersey barrier, jersey wall: separates lanes of traffic (often opposing lanes of traffic) with a goal
of minimizing vehicle crossover in the case of accidents.

hibernation:
Animals enter hibernation during winter to conserve energy by going into a deep sleep-like state.
Mammals, such as gophers, bears, skunks, raccoons, hamsters, and bats, lower their metabolism
and enter a state of torpor, but they are not asleep.
A list of hibernating animals might include the following mammals: Chipmunks, ground squirrels,
echidnas, possums, hedgehogs, hamsters, skunks, bats, prairie dogs, marmots, badgers, and some lemurs.
Among non-mammals, you can find species of lizards, frogs, toads, newts, snakes, turtles, and
insects like bees that hibernate

Torpor is a kind of deep sleep accompanied by drastically lowered body temperature,
heart rate, and breathing. Like a short-term hibernation.

Estivation or aestivation (from Latin aestas, summer) is a rare state of
dormancy similar to hibernation, but during the months of the summer.

Cold-blooded animals (ectotherms) are animals that do not have an internal mechanism
for regulating body temperature, relying instead on solar energy captured by the environment.
 Reptiles, amphibians and fish are examples of cold-blooded animals.
Cold-blooded creatures take on the temperature of their surroundings.
Warm-blooded creatures, like mammals and birds, try to keep the inside of their bodies at a constant temperature.

Warm-bloodedness generally refers to three separate aspects of thermoregulation:
1. Endothermy is the ability of some creatures to control their body temperatures
 through internal means such as muscle shivering, fat burning, and panting
2. Homeothermy is thermoregulation that maintains a stable internal body temperature regardless of external influence
3. Tachymetabolism is the kind of thermoregulation used by creatures that maintain a high resting metabolism

Cold-bloodedness generally refers to three separate areas of thermoregulation:
1. Ectothermy - This refers to creatures that control body temperature through external means
2. Poikilothermy - This refers to creatures whose internal temperatures vary, often matching the ambient temperature of the immediate environment
3. Bradymetabolism - This term refers to creatures with a high active metabolism and a
considerably slower resting metabolism

The standard model of particle physics is a theory that describes three of the four
 known fundamental interactions between the elementary particles that make up all matter.
 It is a quantum field theory developed between 1970 and 1973 which is consistent with both
 quantum mechanics and special relativity.
The Standard Model describes approximately 200 elementary particles and their interactions using 6 quarks,
 6 leptons and a few force-carrying particles.
strong force: gluon
electromagnetic: photon
weak nuclear: W+, W-, Z
gravity: graviton (unconfirmed)
two categories of particles: quark and lepton.
lepton (e.g., electron): are immune to the strong force. have no color
quarks have color (a property akin to spin)

boson: force-carrying particle

Refraction is the change in direction of a wave due to a change in its speed. This is
most commonly seen when a wave passes from one medium to another.

Diffraction refers to various phenomena associated with the bending of waves when they
interact with obstacles in their path.

Onomatopoeia: The formation or use of words such as buzz or murmur that imitate the sounds

fiat currency: money backed by faith (backed by an authority)

gold standard is a monetary system in which the standard economic unit of account is a
fixed weight of gold. Under the gold standard, currency issuers guarantee
to redeem notes, upon demand, in that amount of gold.
In other words, gold standard is a monetary system under which the issuer of a currency
guarantee to redeem the currency for a fixed amount of gold.
history of money: commodity money (in which actual valuable objects are bartered);
representative money (in which paper notes are used represent real commodities stored
elsewhere; fiat money (in which paper notes are backed only by a government.

The theory of the gold standard rests on the idea that inflation is caused by
 an increase in the supply of money, an idea advocated by David Hume, and that
 uncertainty over the future purchasing power of currency depresses business
confidence and leads to reduced trade and capital investment.

advantage: limit inflation disadvantage: Loss of control over economic policy
Prevent the country from printing too much money.
To avoid a gold standard-generated run on the dollar.

Bretton Woods System (1946) created a system of fixed exchange rates that allowed

legislature: An officially elected or otherwise selected body of people vested with the
responsibility and power to make laws for a political unit, such as a state or nation.
Legislatures are known by many names, the most common being parliament and congress,
although these terms also have more specific meanings. The main job of the legislature
is to make and interpret laws. In parliamentary systems of government, the legislature
is formally supreme and appoints the executive. In presidential systems of government,
the legislature is considered a power branch which is equal to, and independent of,
the executive.

In most parliamentary systems, the lower house is the more powerful house while
 the upper house is merely a chamber of advice or review.

A parliamentary system, also known as parliamentarianism (and parliamentarism in
 U.S. English), is distinguished by the executive branch of government being
dependent on the direct or indirect support of the parliament, often expressed
through a vote of confidence. Hence, there is no clear-cut separation of powers
between the executive and legislative branches, leading to a differing set of
 checks and balances compared to those found in a presidential republic.
Parliamentary systems usually have a clear differentiation between the head
of government and the head of state, with the head of government being the
prime minister or premier, and the head of state often being an elected
 (either popularly or through parliament) president or hereditary monarch.

A federation (Latin: foedus, covenant) is a union comprising a number of partially
 self-governing states or regions united by a central ("federal") government. In
a federation, the self-governing status of the component states is typically
constitutionally entrenched and may not be altered by a unilateral decision of the central government.

The form of government or constitutional structure found in a federation is known as federalism.
It can be considered the opposite of another system, the unitary state

The Head of Government is the chief officer of the executive branch of a government,
often presiding over a cabinet. In a parliamentary system, the head of government is
often styled Prime Minister, Premier, etc. In presidential republics or monarchies,
 the head of government may be the same person as the head of state, who is often a president
(of the republic) or a monarch.

head of state: or Chief of state is the generic term for the individual or
collective office that serves as the chief public representative of a monarchic
 or republican nation-state, federation, commonwealth or any other political
 state. His or her role generally includes personifying the continuity and
legitimacy of the state and exercising the political powers, functions and
duties granted the head of state in the country's laws and constitution.
+++
presides over ceremonial functions. usually does not have governing power.

Different countries have different executive systems but in essence four major, generalizing categories can be distinguished:

   1. the non-executive head of state system, in which the head of state does not
	 hold any executive power and mainly plays a symbolic role on behalf of the state;
   2. the parliamentary system, in which the head of state possesses executive
	 power but the exercise of this power is done on the advice of a cabinet;
   3. the presidential (or imperial) system, in which the head of state is also
	the head of government and actively exercises executive power; and,
   4. the semi-presidential system, in which the head of state shares exercise
	of executive power with a head of government.

A presidential system, also called a congressional system, is a system of government
 where an executive branch exists and presides (hence the term) separately from the
legislature, to which it is not accountable and which cannot in normal circumstances dismiss it.

two-round system: runoff voting

A cabinet is a body of high-ranking members of government, typically representing
the executive branch. It can also sometimes be referred to as the Council of Ministers,
an Executive Council or an Executive Committee.
In some countries, particularly those under the Westminster system, the cabinet
collectively decides the government's policy and tactical direction, especially
in regard to legislation passed by the parliament. In countries with a presidential
system, such as the United States, the cabinet does not function as a collective
legislative influence; rather, their primary role is as an unofficial advisory
council to the head of government, consisting of the heads of the executive departments
 they are appointed to lead.

A coalition government, or coalition cabinet, is a cabinet of a parliamentary government
in which several parties cooperate. The usual reason given for this arrangement is
that no party on its own can achieve a majority in the parliament.

Single transferable vote (STV) is a preferential voting system designed to minimize
 wasted votes and provide proportional representation while ensuring that votes are
explicitly for candidates rather than party lists. It achieves this by using multi-seat
constituencies (districts) and by transferring votes that would otherwise be wasted.
 STV initially allocates an individual's vote to his or her most preferred candidate,
 and then subsequently transfers unneeded or unused votes after candidates are either
elected or eliminated, according to the voter's stated preferences

first past the post: winner-takes-all, plurality voting.
The plurality voting system is a single-winner voting system often used to elect
executive officers or to elect members of a legislative assembly which is based on single-member
constituencies.
A voting system in which a single winner is chosen in a given constituency by having
more votes than any other individual representative.
+++
the person receiving the greatest number of votes in each voting region wins.

Proportional representation (sometimes referred to as full representation, or PR), is
a category of electoral formula aiming at a close match between the percentage of votes
 that groups of candidates (grouped by a certain measure) obtain in elections and the
percentage of seats they receive (usually in legislative assemblies).
PR: the number of seats allocated to a group is proportional to the number of votes
received by that group.

parliamentary democracy relies upon the election of representatives from each voting region
 to form a governing body.
The party that holds the majority in parliament is held to be in control, and its leader
becomes the prime minister.
+++
parliamentary representatives are elected by voting regions.

cousin:
A system of degrees and removes is used to describe the relationship between the
two cousins and the ancestor they have in common. The degree (first, second, third
cousin, etc.) indicates the minimum number of generations between either cousin and
the nearest common ancestor; the remove (once removed, twice removed, etc.) indicates
 the number of generations, if any, separating the two cousins from each other.
For example, a person with whom you share a grandparent is your first cousin; someone
with whom you share a great-grandparent is a second cousin. Where your relationship
to the nearest common ancestor is different from your cousin's relationship then the
 term removed is used to indicate this, for example the child of your first cousin
is your first cousin once removed because there is a generation between you.

boundary condition: The set of conditions specified for the solution to
a set of differential equations at the boundary of its domain.
In mathematics, in the field of differential equations, a boundary value problem is
 a differential equation together with a set of additional restraints, called the
boundary conditions. A solution to a boundary value problem is a solution to the
 differential equation which also satisfies the boundary conditions.

The rotation curve of a galaxy can be represented by a graph that plots the orbital
velocity of the stars or gas in the galaxy on the y-axis against the distance from the
 center of the galaxy on the x-axis. Stars revolve around the center of galaxies at a
constant speed over a large range of distances from the center of the galaxy. Thus they
 revolve much faster than would be expected if they were in a free Newtonian potential.
=================
The galaxy rotation problem is this discrepancy between the observed rotation speeds of
 matter in the disk portions of spiral galaxies and the predictions of
Newtonian dynamics considering the visible mass.
=================
One of the theories for explaining this discrepancy is the presence of dark matter.
Galactic rotation curves, which illustrate the velocity of rotation versus the distance
from the galactic center, cannot be explained by only the visible matter.
Hypothetical form of matter for explaining the discrepancy between the observed
speed and the theoretical speed of stars revolving around the center of galaxies.

dark matter halo:
Most of the mass of any galaxy is dominated by a component concentrated at
the centre of the galaxy but dominating its dynamics throughout, known as the dark matter halo.
The presence of dark matter in the halo is demonstrated by its gravitational effect
 on a spiral galaxy's rotation curve. Without large amounts of mass in the extended halo,
the rotational velocity of the galaxy should decrease at large distance from the galactic
core. However, observations of spiral galaxies, particularly radio observations of line
emission from neutral atomic hydrogen (known, in astronomical parlance, as HI), show that
 the rotation curve of most spiral galaxies remains flat far beyond the visible matter.
 The absence of any visible matter to account for these observations implies the presence
 of unobserved (i.e. dark) matter. Asserting that this dark matter does not exist would
 mean that the accepted theory of gravitation (General Relativity) is wrong, something
that could be possible but most scientists would require extensive amounts of compelling evidence before considering it.

dark matter is a hypothetical form of matter that does not emit or reflect enough
electromagnetic radiation to be observed directly, but whose presence can be inferred
 from gravitational effects on visible matter.

Nucleation is the onset of a phase transition in a small region. The phase
transition can be the formation of a bubble or of a crystal from a liquid.
 Creation of liquid droplets in saturated vapor or the creation of gaseous
bubble in a saturated liquid is also characterized by nucleation

Nucleation normally occurs at nucleation sites on surfaces containing
 the liquid or vapor. Suspended particles or minute bubbles also provide
nucleation sites. This is called heterogeneous nucleation. Nucleation without
 preferential nucleation sites is homogeneous nucleation. Homogeneous nucleation
occurs spontaneously and randomly, but it requires superheating or supercooling of the medium.

Supercooling is the process of chilling a liquid below its freezing point, without it becoming solid.
A liquid below its freezing point will crystallize in the presence of a seed
crystal or nucleus around which a crystal structure can form. However, lacking
any such nucleus, the liquid phase can be maintained all the way down to the
temperature at which crystal homogeneous nucleation occurs.

superheating (sometimes referred to as boiling retardation, or boiling delay)
is the phenomenan in which a liquid is heated to a temperature higher than
its standard boiling point, without actually boiling. This can be caused by
 rapidly heating a homogeneous substance while leaving it undisturbed
 (in order to avoid the introduction of bubbles at nucleation sites).

Small particles (seeds) can trigger the separation of the dissolved material
 from the solvent or condensation of the vapor. Seeds triggering the
condensation of vapor are referred to as condensation nuclei, as in the case of water vapor.

Supersaturation refers to a solution that contains more of the
dissolved material than could be dissolved by the solvent under normal
circumstances. It can also refer to a vapor of a compound that has a
higher (partial) pressure than the vapor pressure of that compound.

Carbonated water is a supersaturated solution of carbon dioxide gas in water.
 At the elevated pressure in the bottle, carbon dioxide can dissolve in water
 more than at atmospheric pressure. At atmospheric pressure, the carbon
 dioxide gas escapes very slowly from the supersaturated liquid. This
process may be accelerated by the presence of nucleation sites within
 the solution, such as small bubbles, caused by shaking the bottle,
or another solute, such as sugar powder or a widget. A Diet Coke and
 Mentos eruption is a rather extreme example. Some beverage products
 such as ales and stouts e.g. Guinness rely on this effect to produce
 the 'head' on the surface of the poured product.
Scuba divers' tissues become supersaturated with breathing gases during a dive.
If the diver ascends too fast, these gases form bubbles, resulting in decompression sickness.
In air that is supersaturated with water, water droplets may precipitate upon being disturbed.

Vapor pressure (also known as equilibrium vapor pressure or saturation vapor pressure),
is the pressure of a vapor in equilibrium with its non-vapor phases. All liquids and
solids have a tendency to evaporate to a gaseous form, and all gases have a tendency
to condense back into their original form (either liquid or solid). At any given
temperature, for a particular substance, there is a pressure at which the gas of
that substance is in dynamic equilibrium with its liquid or solid forms. This is
the vapor pressure of that substance at that temperature. The equilibrium vapor
pressure is an indication of a liquid's evaporation rate. It relates to the tendency
 of molecules and atoms to escape from a liquid or a solid.

The boiling point of a liquid is the temperature at which the vapor pressure
 of the liquid equals the environmental pressure surrounding the liquid

Opportunity cost is the cost (sacrifice) incurred by choosing one option over
an alternative one that may be equally desired.
Opportunity cost is the cost of pursuing one choice instead of another.
Every action has an opportunity cost.
Opportunity cost is not restricted to monetary or financial costs: the real
 cost of output forgone, lost time, pleasure or any other benefit that provides
 utility should also be considered.
When economists refer to the "opportunity cost" of a resource, they mean the
value of the next-best alternative use of that resource. If, for
example, you spend time and money going to a movie, you cannot spend that
time at home reading a book, and you can't spend the money on something else.
 If your next-best alternative to seeing the movie is reading the book, then
the opportunity cost of seeing the movie is the money spent plus the pleasure
you forgo by not reading the book.
Scarcity of resources is one of the more basic concepts of economics.
Scarcity necessitates trade-offs, and trade-offs result in an opportunity
cost. While the cost of a good or service often is thought of in monetary
 terms, the opportunity cost of a decision is based on what must be given
up (the next best alternative) as a result of the decision. Any decision
that involves a choice between two or more options has an opportunity cost.

TANSTAAFL is an acronym for the adage "There Ain't No Such Thing As A Free Lunch,"
popularized by science fiction writer Robert A. Heinlein in his 1966 novel
The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress, which discusses the problems caused by
 not considering the eventual outcome of an unbalanced economy.

The parable of the broken window was created by Frdric Bastiat in his 1850
essay Ce qu'on voit et ce qu'on ne voit pas (That Which Is Seen and That Which Is Unseen)
 to illuminate the notion of hidden costs.
Bastiat uses this story to introduce a concept he calls the broken window fallacy,
 which is related to the law of unintended consequences, in that both involve an
incomplete accounting for the consequences of an action.
The parable describes a shopkeeper whose window is broken by a little boy. Everyone
sympathizes with the man whose window was broken, but pretty soon they start to
suggest that the broken window makes work for the glazier, who will then buy
bread, benefiting the baker, who will then buy shoes, benefiting the cobbler,
 etc. Finally, the onlookers conclude that the little boy was not guilty of
vandalism; instead he was a public benefactor, creating economic benefits for everyone in town.
The fallacy of the onlookers' argument is that they considered only the positive
benefits of purchasing a new window, but they ignored the cost to the shopkeeper. As
 the shopkeeper was forced to spend his money on a new window, he obviously could
not have spent it on something else. For example, the shopkeeper may have spent
the money on bread and shoes for himself, but now cannot so enrich the baker and
cobbler because he must fix his window.
Thus, the child did not bring any net benefit to the town. Instead, he made the
town poorer by at least the value of one window, if not more

electoral college:
Under the Electoral College system, we do not elect the President and Vice President through
a direct nation-wide vote. The Presidential election is decided by the combined results
 of 51 State elections (in this context, the term "State" includes DC).
 Your vote helps decide which candidate receives your State's electoral votes.
Generally, the political parties nominate electors at their State party conventions
or by a vote of the party's central committee in each State. Electors are often
selected to recognize their service and dedication to their political party. They
may be State elected officials, party leaders, or persons who have a personal or
political affiliation with the Presidential candidate. Then the voters in each
State choose the electors on the day of the general election.
Electoral votes are awarded on the basis of the popular vote in each State.
If no candidate receives a majority of electoral votes, the House of Representatives
 elects the President from the 3 Presidential candidates who received the most
electoral votes. Each State delegation has one vote. The Senate would elect
the Vice President from the 2 Vice Presidential candidates with the most
electoral votes. Each Senator would cast one vote for Vice President. If
the House of Representatives fails to elect a President by Inauguration
 Day, the Vice-President Elect serves as acting President until the deadlock is resolved in the House.
Maine and Nebraska do not do winner-takes-all
For example, Maine has four electoral votes. Two electors are selected on
the basis of the statewide vote and two are selected according to outcome
 of the vote in each of Maine's two Congressional districts. Nebraska's five
electoral votes are distributed in the same manner:   two based on the statewide
vote, and three based on the results in Congressional districts.
The Electoral College was established by the founding fathers as a compromise between
election of the president by Congress and election by popular vote. The electors are
a popularly elected body chosen by the States and the District of Columbia on the
Tuesday after the first Monday in November
The slates of electors are generally chosen by the political parties.
No Constitutional provision or Federal law requires electors to vote in accordance with
the popular vote in their States.

deductible: the amount a person must pay first (in addition to the premium) before
insurance coverage will pay for a loss on an insurance claim.
The amount a beneficiary pays out-of-pocket before insurance benefits are paid.
The annual deductible is the amount you are responsible for under the health plan
before the health plan will begin to pay.

copay: copay is usually a flat fee. For example, every time you go to the doctor
 you pay a 25.00 copay for the office visit, regardless of the level of service you receive.
Co-payments are charged and paid at the time you receive certain types of services,
such as office visits, prescription drugs, and emergency room services.
 These charges do not apply to the out-of-pocket maximum??

Coinsurance: coinsurance is a term used for a percentage amount you are responsible for.
For example if your insurance policy is 80/20, where you are responsible for paying 20% of
your bill, the 20% is a coinsurance.
Coinsurance is the percentage of each claim above the deductible that you pay.
 If the coinsurance is 20 percent, you pay for the deductible plus 20% of the covered expenses.
Coinsurance Applies After The Services.

the main difference between assisted living and a nursing home is "the level of care
someone needs." She says a nursing home would be the right choice for someone who
 doesn't need to be in a hospital, but who needs fairly constant nursing care.
An assisted living facility typically offers more independence and less intensive medical care
a nursing home is a facility designed for someone who needs less care than a

Ultra high frequency (UHF) designates a range (band) of electromagnetic waves with
 frequencies between 300 MHz and 3 GHz (3,000 MHz).

Radio waves with frequencies above the UHF band fall into the SHF (Super high frequency)
 and EHF (Extremely high frequency) bands; all of which fall into the Microwave frequency range.

Very high frequency (VHF) is the radio frequency range from 30 MHz to 300 MHz

Common uses for VHF are FM radio broadcast, television broadcast (together with UHF)

VHF propagation characteristics are ideal for short-distance terrestrial communication,
with a range generally somewhat farther than line-of-sight from the transmitter.
 Unlike high frequencies (HF), the ionosphere does not usually reflect VHF radio
and thus transmissions are restricted to the local area (and don't interfere with
transmissions thousands of kilometres away). VHF is also less affected by atmospheric
 noise and interference from electrical equipment than lower frequencies. Whilst it
is more easily blocked by land features than HF and lower frequencies, it is less
 bothered by buildings and other less substantial objects than UHF frequencies.

VHF: TV channel 2-13
VHF:
88-108 MHz: FM radio broadcasting (88-92 non-commercial, 92-108 commercial in the United States)

UHF: TV channel 14-69

A continental divide is a line of elevated terrain which forms a border
 between two watersheds such that water falling on one side of the line
 eventually travels to one ocean or body of water, and water on the other
 side travels to another, generally on the opposite side of the continent.

A drainage basin is an extent of land where water from rain or snow melt drains
 downhill into a body of water, such as a river, lake, reservoir, estuary, wetland,
sea or ocean. The drainage basin includes both the streams and rivers that convey
 the water as well as the land surfaces from which water drains into those channels,
 and is separated from adjacent basins by a drainage divide.
The drainage basin acts like a funnel, collecting all the water within the
 area covered by the basin and channelling it into a waterway. Each drainage
 basin is separated topographically from adjacent basins by a geographical
barrier such as a ridge, hill or mountain, which is known as a water divide.
Other terms that are used to describe the a drainage basin are catchment,
catchment area, catchment basin, drainage area, river basin water basin and watershed.
In the technical sense, a watershed refers to a divide that separates one drainage
area from another drainage area.[3] However, in the United States and Canada, the
term is often used to mean a drainage basin or catchment area itself.

high altitude:
At high altitude, atmospheric pressure is lower compared to sea level. This
is due to two competing physical effects: gravity, which causes the air to be
 as close as possible to the ground; and the heat content of the air, which
causes the molecules to bounce off each other and expand.
Because of the lower pressure, the air expands as it rises, which causes it to cool.
Thus, high altitude air is cold,

Richard Dawkins coined the word "meme" as a neologism in his book
The Selfish Gene (1976) to describe how one might extend evolutionary principles
 to explain the spread of ideas and cultural phenomena. He gave as examples
 melodies, catch-phrases, beliefs (notably religious belief, clothing/fashion,

State of matter
A state of matter (or physical state, or form of matter) has physical properties
 which are qualitatively different from other states of matter.
Traditionally three states of matter were recognized : solid which maintains
 a fixed volume and shape, liquid maintains a fixed volume but adopts the shape
 of its container, and gas which occupies the entire volume available.
+++++++
a solid to a liquid = melting (heat energy added) e.g. ice melts to water
a liquid to a gas = evaporation (heat energy added) e.g. water to water vapour
a solid to a gas = sublimation (heat energy added) e.g. dried ice (frozen CO2) to carbon dioxide
a gas to a liquid = condensation (heat energy removed) e.g. cloud to rain
a liquid to a solid = freezing (heat energy removed) e.g. water to ice
a gas to a solid = deposition (heat energy removed) e.g. water vapour to frost
++++
plasma: An electrically neutral, highly ionized gas composed of ions, electrons, and neutral particles.
 It is a phase of matter distinct from solids, liquids, and normal gases.
+++
Plasma is the fourth state of matter. It is hotter than a gas. A plasma occurs when the
temperature is between 1000 degrees C and 1,000,000,000 degrees C. Some examples of
 plasma are the charged air around lightning and stars, including our own sun.
As a gas is heated, electrons begin to leave the atoms, resulting in the presence of
free electrons, which are not bound to an atom or molecule, and ions, which are chemical
species that contain unequal number of electrons and protons, and therefore possess an
electrical charge. The free electric charges make the plasma electrically conductive so
 that it responds strongly to electromagnetic fields. At very high temperatures,
 such as those present in stars, it is assumed that essentially all electrons
 are "free," and that a very high-energy plasma is essentially bare nuclei swimming
in a sea of electrons. Plasma is believed to be the most common state of matter in the universe.
+++
plasma is an ionized gas, in which a certain proportion of electrons are free
rather than being bound to an atom or molecule. The ability of the positive and negative
 charges to move somewhat independently makes the plasma electrically conductive so
that it responds strongly to electromagnetic fields. Plasma therefore has properties
 quite unlike those of solids, liquids or gases and is considered to be a distinct
 state of matter. Plasma typically takes the form of neutral gas-like clouds (e.g. stars).
 The explanation of the example, star, is a massive, luminous ball of plasma.

 see when you exhale and "see your breath".
+++
How long a contrail remains intact, depends on the humidity structure and winds
of the upper troposphere. If the atmosphere is near saturation, the contrail may
 exist for sometime. On the other hand, if the atmosphere is dry then as the contrail
 mixes with the environment it dissipates.
+++
Jet fuel is made of carbon and hydrogen.
When jet fuel burns with oxygen, most of the exhaust consists of CO2 (carbon dioxide)
and H2O (water). The water is generally an invisible vapor.
+++
When you exhale, your breath contains a great deal of invisible water vapor as well.
You may have noticed that on certain days in the winter, your breath will form a cloud
of condensation when you exhale. In the summer, however, you don't see your breath.
Cold air can hold a lot less moisture than warm air, so in the winter, when the
moisture in your breath hits the cold air, the moisture condenses into a visible cloud.
+++
The same thing happens when a jet engine "exhales." If the temperature, winds and humidity
 in the upper atmosphere are right, long, white contrails form when the moisture in
 the exhaust condenses.
+++++++
The main products of hydrocarbon fuel combustion are carbon dioxide and water vapor.
At high altitudes this water vapor emerges into a cold environment, and the local
increase in water vapor can push the water content of the air past saturation point.
 The vapor then condenses into tiny water droplets and/or deposits into ice. These
 millions of tiny water droplets and/or ice crystals form the vapour trail or
contrails. The energy drop (and therefore, time and distance) the vapor needs
to condense accounts for the contrail forming some way behind the aircraft's engines.
++
Exhaust vapour trails or contrails usually occur above 8000 metres (26,000 feet). where
the temperature is below -40C.
++++++++++++++++++
Contrails are clouds formed when water vapor condenses and freezes around small
particles (aerosols) that exist in aircraft exhaust. Some of that water vapor comes
 from the air around the plane; and, some is added by the exhaust of the aircraft.

cloud:
Clouds form when relatively warm air containing water vapor is lighter than its
surrounding air and this causes it to rise. As it rises it cools and the vapor
condenses out of the air as micro-droplets. These tiny particles of water are
 relatively densely packed and sunlight cannot penetrate far into the cloud before
 it is reflected out, giving a cloud its characteristic white color. As a cloud
 matures, the droplets may combine to produce larger droplets, which may combine
to form droplets large enough to fall as rain.

absolute humidity:
is the mass of water vapor divided by the mass of dry air in a volume of air at a
given temperature. The hotter the air is, the more water it can contain.
++
relative humidity:
is the ratio of the current absolute humidity to the highest possible absolute humidity
(which depends on the current air temperature).
A reading of 100 percent relative humidity means that the air is totally saturated with
 water vapor and cannot hold any more, creating the possibility of rain. This doesn't
mean that the relative humidity must be 100 percent in order for it to rain -- it
must be 100 percent where the clouds are forming, but the relative humidity near
 the ground could be much less.
If the air is at 100-percent relative humidity, sweat will not evaporate into the
air. As a result, we feel much hotter than the actual temperature when the relative humidity is high.

Psychological Projection:
In psychology, psychological projection (or projection bias) is a defense mechanism in which
one attributes one's own unacceptable or unwanted thoughts or/and emotions to others.
Projection reduces anxiety by allowing the expression of the unwanted subconscious
impulses/desires without letting the conscious mind recognize them. The theory
was developed by Sigmund Freud and further refined by his daughter Anna Freud,

third-party check:
Say Jack has a cheque from Bob, and Jack wants to pay walmart with that cheque...that would be
 a 3rd party check. Essentially it would be a cheque you are using (with the permission of
who ever owns the cheque) to pay someone, so the owner of the cheque would be the 3rd party
 since they are outside of the acutal transaction betwen you and who ever you are paying.
 Hardly anywhere will accept a third party check because of the high risk of fraud.
+++++
If somebody gives you a check, and you turn it over and write "pay to the order of ____" in
order to give it to a third party, that makes it a third party check. An example would be

tickler file:
A tickler file is a collection of date-labeled file folders organized in a way that allows
time-sensitive documents to be filed according to the future date on which each document needs action.
 Documents within the folders of a tickler file can be to-do lists, pending bills, unpaid invoices,
travel tickets, hotel reservations, meeting information, birthday reminders, coupons, claim tickets,
call-back notes, follow-up reminders, maintenance reminders, or any other papers that require
future action. Each day, the folder having the current date is retrieved from the tickler file
so that any documents within it may be acted on. Essentially, a tickler file provides a way
 to send a reminder to oneself in the future: "tickling" one's memory.

leased line
A leased line connects two locations for private voice and/or data telecommunication service.
Not a dedicated cable, a leased line is actually a reserved circuit between two points. Leased
lines can span short or long distances. They maintain a single open circuit at all times,
as opposed to traditional telephone services that reuse the same lines for many different
conversations through a process called "switching."

when a disc is damaged, it may bulge or break open. This is called a herniated disc.
It may also be called a slipped or ruptured disc.

Spinal nerve roots branch out from each side of the spinal cord and then join to form
 the spinal nerves, which pass through openings between the spinal bones (vertebrae) and
then form branches that extend throughout the body.
Each spinal nerve is attached to the spinal cord by 2 nerve roots.

dumpster: emptied into garbage truck

dump truck
A dump truck or production truck is a truck used for transporting loose material

bulldozer:
A bulldozer is a crawler (caterpillar tracked tractor), equipped with a substantial metal plate
(known as a blade), used to push large quantities of soil, sand, rubble, etc., during construction work.
the term refers only to a tractor (usually tracked) fitted with a dozer blade.

loader
A loader (also known as: bucket loader, front loader, front end loader, payloader, scoop loader,
shovel, skip loader, and/or wheel loader) is a type of tractor, usually wheeled, sometimes on tracks,
 that has a front mounted square wide bucket connected to the end of two booms (arms) to scoop up
loose material from the ground, such as dirt, sand or gravel, and move it from one place to another
without pushing the material across the ground. A loader is commonly used to move a stockpiled
material from ground level and deposit it into an awaiting dump truck or into a open trench excavation.

deduction vs induction
The logical processes known as deduction and induction work in opposite ways. In deduction general
 principles are applied to specific instances. Thus, using a mathematical formula to figure the
 volume of air that can be contained in a gymnasium is applying deduction. Similarly, applying
a law of physics to predict the outcome of an experiment is reasoning by deduction. By contrast,
induction makes generalizations based on a number of specific instances. The observation of hundreds
of examples in which a certain chemical kills plants might prompt the inductive conclusion that the
 chemical is toxic to all plants. Inductive generalizations are often revised as more examples are
 studied and more facts are known. If certain plants that have not been tested turn out to be
unaffected by the chemical, the conclusion about the chemical's toxicity must be revised or
 restricted. In this way, an inductive generalization is much like a hypothesis.

90th percentile

heuristic
is an adjective for experience-based techniques that help in problem solving, learning and discovery.
A heuristic method is particularly used to rapidly come to a solution that is hoped to be close to

heuristics:
an experience-based approach to problem solving
++
pertains to the process of gaining knowledge or some desired result by intelligent guesswork rather than
by following some preestablished formula. (Heuristic can be contrasted with algorithm ic.)
The term seems to have two usages:
1) Describing an approach to learning by trying without necessarily having an organized hypothesis
 or way of proving that the results proved or disproved the hypothesis. That is, "seat-of-the-pants"
 or "trial-by-error" learning.
2) Pertaining to the use of the general knowledge gained by experience, sometimes expressed as
"using a rule-of-thumb." (However, heuristic knowledge can be applied to complex as well as simple

java.util.List interface is a subtype of the java.util.Collection interface.

list implementation: ArrayList, LinkedList, Vector, Stack

java.util.Set interface

set implemention: EnumSet, HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet
HashSet is backed by a HashMap. It makes no guarantees about the sequence of the elements when you iterate them
LinkedHashSet differs from HashSet by guaranteeing that the order of the elements during iteration is
the same as the order they were inserted into the LinkedHashSet. Reinserting an element that is already in
the LinkedHashSet does not change this order.
TreeSet also guarantees the order of the elements when iterated, but the order is the sorting order of the elements.

diff btw HashSet and Set: Hashset allows null

java.util.SortedSet interface is a subtype of the java.util.Set. actual implementation: java.util.TreeSet

The order of the sorting is either the natural sorting order of the elements (if they implement
java.lang.Comparable), or the order determined by a Comparator that you can give to the SortedSet

java.util.Map interface: a dictionary
	implementation: HashMap, HashTable, EnumMap, IdentityHashMap, LinkedHashMap,
	Properties, TreeMap, WeakHashMap
	note: key must be an object, no primitive type
	Note: Properties is a subclass of HashTable, each key and value is a string
	Hashtable is one of the original collection classes in Java. HashMap is
	 part of the new Collections Framework, added with Java 2, v1.2.
	Hashtable is synchronized, HashMap is not.
	iterator in the HashMap is fail-safe while the enumerator for the Hashtable isn't.
	HashMap permits null values in it, while Hashtable doesn't. conclusion: use HashMap

Properties: a subclass of HashTable: Properties.load(inputStream): load properties file
properties.keySet() : return a set of keys
properties.values() : return a collection of values
properties.entrySet() : return a collection of Map.Entry, which a key-value pair (like Association in Smalltalk)

HashMap: no sequencing
TreeMap: order (iteration order is the sort order of keys/values)

// key iterator
Iterator iterator = mapA.keySet().iterator();

// value iterator
Iterator iterator = mapA.values();

Iterator iterator = mapA.keySet().iterator();
while(iterator.hasNext(){
  Object key   = iterator.next();
  Object value = mapA.get(key);

java.util.Queue interface (inserted at the end of the queue, and elements removed from the beginning of the queue)
	implementation: LinkedList, PriorityQueue

java.util.Deque  (a queue where you can insert and remove elements from both ends of the queue) Double Ended Queue"
	ArrayDeque, LinkedList

implement hashCode() and equals()

sorting: sort List collections using the java.util.Collections.sort()
	can sort List and LinkedList
++
List list = new ArrayList();

//add elements to the list

Collections.sort(list);

For objects to have a natural order they must implement the interface java.lang.Comparable

public interface Comparable<T> {
  int compareTo(T o);
}

 The compareTo() method should compare this object to another object, return an int value. Here are the rules for that int value:

    * Return a negative value if this object is smaller than the other object
    * Return 0 (zero) if this object is equal to the other object.
    * Return a positive value if this object is larger than the other object

Comparator (non-natural order)
List list = new ArrayList();

//add elements to the list

Comparator comparator = new SomeComparator();

Collections.sort(list, comparator);

or implements the Comparator interface
	2 methods: compare(), equals()

synchronization wrapper: Map m = Collections.synchronizedMap(new HashMap(...));
The iterators returned by all of this class's "collection view methods" are fail-fast: if the
map is structurally modified at any time after the iterator is created, in any way except
through the iterator's own remove or add methods, the iterator will throw a ConcurrentModificationException.

Enumeration is legacy, not in the new Collection framework
	contains 2 methods namely hasMoreElements() & nextElement().
Iterator is new , in the collection framework
	three methods namely hasNext(), next(),remove().
diff: Iterator: can remove elements during iteration

Cloneable interface:
A class implements the Cloneable interface to indicate to the Object.clone() method that it
is legal for that method to make a field-for-field copy of instances of that class.
Invoking Object's clone method on an instance that does not implement the Cloneable interface
 results in the exception CloneNotSupportedException being thrown.
By convention, classes that implement this interface should override Object.clone (which is protected)
 with a public method. See Object.clone() for details on overriding this method.

ByteArrayInputStream: read data from byte arrays as streams
DataInputStream: enables you to read Java primitives from InputStream's instead of only bytes
PrintStream: enables you to write formatted data to an underlying OutputStream.
PrintWriter: enables you to write formatted data to an underlying Writer
StringWriter: enables you to obtain the characters written to a Writer  as a String: uses StringBuffer
So StringWriter is basically an Adapter that adapts a StringBuffer to the Writer interface.

stream: continuous flow of data you can read from or write to. no concept of index.

exception wrapping
wrapping is when you catch an exception, wrap it in a different exception and throw that exception.
to prevent the code further up the call stack from having to know about every possible exception in the system.
--> do not want to end up with top level methods that declare many different exceptions.
--> you may not want your top level components to know anything about the bottom level components,

Exception wrapping may result in very long stack traces consisting of one stack trace for each exception
in the wrapping hierarchy.
The messages of the exceptions are spread out over the stack traces.

another approach: exception enrichment : add additional info to an exception

ISO image
An ISO image is an archive file (also known as a disc image) of an optical disc in a format defined by
the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). This format is supported by many software vendors.
 ISO image files typically have a file extension of .iso. The name ISO is taken from the ISO 9660 file
system used with CD-ROM media, but an ISO image can also contain a UDF file system since UDF
 is backward-compatible with ISO 9660.
+++
In the context of files and programs, an "image", whether an ISO, floppy, or other media image,
 is simply a file that can be used as a virtually identical copy of the original media. This file not
only contains individual data files; it also contains track and sector information and arranges all
this information in a file system, just like disk media. Image files, unlike normal files, are
usually not opened; rather, they are mounted.
An ISO image is simply a CD-ROM or DVD image saved in ISO-9660 format.
++
ISO images are mainly used as source files from which to create media.
After you download the image, you can use CD-burning software to recreate the physical CD-ROM/DVD install media.

OSGi
OSGi (Open Services Gateway Initiative) is an industry plan for a standard way to connect devices
 such as home appliances and security systems to the Internet. With such a standard, home users
 could, for example, install a security system and be able to change from one monitoring service
to another without having to install a new system of wires and devices. The "service gateway"
would be an application server in a computer that was a gateway between the Internet and a home
 or small business's network of device. The OSGi plans to specify the application program interface (API)
for programmers to use to allow communication and control between service providers and the devices
 within the home or small business network. OSGi's API will be built on the Java programming language.

OSGi technology is the dynamic module system for Java

An OSGi Framework is an open, modular and sizeable "Service Delivery Plattform".

OSGi emerged out of work to connect home appliances and security systems to the Internet.
It has since evolved into a more generic SOA componentized model for connecting a variety of services.
initially: a set of standards for a Java-based service framework that could be remotely managed.

3 distinct areas: governance, development, and operations

public-key cryptography
1. To send me an encrypted message, you use my public key to encrypt the message.
2. then I use my private key to decrypt the message

digital signature
1. I have a message/document to send
2. apply a hashing function to the document to create a message digest (aka hash, checksum)
3. to create a digital signature, I sign(encrypt) the message digest with my private key
4. I then send the document and the digital signature (encrypted message digest)
recipient to authenticate:
1. apply the same hashing function to the document.
2. decrypt the encrypted message digest (digital signature) using my public key.
3. compare the output of 1 against the output of 2
If not equal -> (1) someone is impersonating me (2) the document has been altered
(3) error during transmission

Certificates are digital documents attesting to the binding of a public key to an individual or other entity.
In their simplest form, certificates contain a public key and a name

hashing: the transformation of a string of characters into a fixed-length string
in smalltalk: the transformation of an object into an integer, which is used as an
index into a collection.
A hash function H is a transformation that takes an input m and returns a fixed-size string,
which is called the hash value h  (that is, h = H(m)).
A hash function H is said to be one-way if it is hard to invert
The hash value represents concisely the longer message or document from which it was computed;
 this value is called the message digest. One can think of a message digest as
 a "digital fingerprint" of the larger document.

servlet/JSP and EJB
ervlets/JSPs and EJB are complementary, not competing technologies: Servlets provide support for writing web based applications whereas EJBs provide support for writing transactional objects.
JSP or XML/XSL technologies provide support for the front end (UI, client) code, where EJB provides
 support for the back end (database connection pooling, declaritive transactions, declaritive security, standardized parameterization...)

 EJB model mandates  a separation between display and business logic.

Some of the hings that servlets and JSPs can do that EJBs cannot are:

    * Respond to http/https protocol requests.
    * (With JSP) provide an easy way to format HTML output.
    * Easily associate a web user with session information

Some of the things that EJBs enable you to do that servlets/JSPs do not are:

    * Declaritively manage transactions. In EJB, you merely specify whether a bean's methods require,
	disallow, or can be used in the context of a transaction. The EJB container will manage your
	transaction boundaries appropriately. In a purely servlet architecture, you'll have to write code
	 to manage the transaction, which is difficult if a logical transaction must access multiple datasources.
    * Declaritively manage security. The EJB model allows you to indicate a security role that
	the user must be assigned to in order to invoke a method on a bean. In Servlets/JSPs you must
	 write code to do this. Note, however that the security model in EJB is sufficient for
	only 90% to 95% of application code - there are always security scenarios that require reference
	 to values of an entity, etc.

EJB provides:
resource management, transaction management, security, scalability, threading issues, pooling,

Granularity is the extent to which a system is broken down into small parts
It is the extent to which a larger entity is subdivided.
For example, a yard broken into inches has finer granularity than a yard broken into feet

Coarse-grained systems consist of fewer, larger components than fine-grained  systems;
a coarse-grained description of a system regards large subcomponents while a fine-grained
description regards smaller components of which the larger ones are composed.
The granularity of data refers to the fineness with which data fields are sub-divided.
For example, a postal address can be recorded, with low granularity, as a single field:
or with high granularity, as multiple fields:
Higher granularity has overheads for data input and storage.

XML elements vs attributes
one way of thinking about XML elements and attributes uses the concept of visibility.

if the info guides XML processing but is never seen by a user, then it may be better to model it as an attribute.

TV (interlacing)
interlace is a technique of improving the picture quality of a video signal without consuming extra bandwidth.
TV and video pictures are made up of a number of images (frames) that are sequentially displayed
 on your screen to give the illusion of movement. The rate at which the frames are displayed
is fixed at 25 frames-per second (fps) in the PAL system, and 30 fps in the NTSC system.
In order to send these pictures over the air, or along a cable, each frame is split up into a number of horizontal strips (lines),
Each line is transmitted separately to your TV tube where they are 'painted' (scanned) in sequence on the viewing screen, to recreate the original frame images.
Each frame is divided into two parts (fields) by taking even numbered lines as one field, and odd
numbered lines as the other. These two fields are then transmitted in sequence (odd, then even),
instead of the original frame. The rate at which these fields are produced on our TV tube is now twice the frame rate, which reduces the perceptible flicker substantially.
The reason why 50 fields/sec (60 NTSC) is used is to minimise the visual disturbance caused by mains-power interference which would show as a wobble in the picture.
The PAL system comprises 625 lines, of which 574 are active. NTSC has 525 lines, of which 485 are active.
NTSC: 60 fields every second, resulting in 30 frames per second

+++
also known as "port forwarding," is the transmission of data intended for use only within a private,
usually corporate network through a public network in such a way that the routing nodes in the public
network are unaware that the transmission is part of a private network. Tunneling is generally done by
 encapsulating the private network data and protocol information within the public network transmission
units so that the private network protocol information appears to the public network as data. Tunneling
allows the use of the Internet, which is a public network, to convey data on behalf of a private network.

message semantics:
synchronous/asynchronous, request/reply, transactional, publish/subscribe and guaranteed delivery.
 The choice of protocol should depend on messaging requirements, for example a common requirement
is point-to-point versus one-to-many, which drives the request/reply or publish/subscribe decision.
 Another example would be a fast message producer paired with a slow message consumer, which is easily
 implemented with a message queue.

inversion of control (dependency injection)
in the Java EE world, there is the mechanism called the Java Naming and Directory Interfaces (JNDI)
used to look up internal or external services.
These could be an enterprise JavaBean, a database, or a message queue. Instead of the developer doing
all those extra steps to look up internal or external services, the framework does the work and hands
 to the component or object a reference to that external service. In other words, the service look-up
responsibility is delegated to the framework.

OOP: a paradigm where real world problems are decomposed into objects that abstract behavior
and data in a single unit.

AOP is a new technology for separating crosscutting concerns into single units called aspects.
join point: an execution point in a program
point cut: specifies criteria that match join points. a way to specify joint points
advice: a means to specify code to be run at joint points
--> let you add behavior to your POJO without modifying your code
---
1. Aspect: An aspect is a class that implements enterprise application concerns that cut across multiple classes, such as transaction management. Aspects can be a normal class configured through Spring XML configuration or we can use Spring AspectJ integration to define a class as Aspect using @Aspect annotation.
2. Join Point: A join point is the specific point in the application such as method execution, exception handling, changing object variable values etc. In Spring AOP a join points is always the execution of a method.
3. Advice: Advices are actions taken for a particular join point. In terms of programming, they are methods that gets executed when a certain join point with matching pointcut is reached in the application. You can think of Advices as Struts2 interceptors or Servlet Filters.
 --> define the what and when of an aspect
4. Pointcut: Pointcut are expressions that is matched with join points to determine whether advice needs to be executed or not. Pointcut uses different kinds of expressions that are matched with the join points and Spring framework uses the AspectJ pointcut expression language.Target Object: They are the object on which advices are applied. Spring AOP is implemented using runtime proxies so this object is always a proxied object. What is means is that a subclass is created at runtime where the target method is overridden and advices are included based on their configuration.
  --> define the where.
5. AOP proxy: Spring AOP implementation uses JDK dynamic proxy to create the Proxy classes with target classes and advice invocations, these are called AOP proxy classes. We can also use CGLIB proxy by adding it as the dependency in the Spring AOP project.
6. Weaving: It is the process of linking aspects with other objects to create the advised proxy objects. This can be done at compile time, load time or at runtime. Spring AOP performs weaving at the runtime.
 --> weaving: the process of applying aspects to a target object to create a new proxied object.
-- The key unit of modularity in OOP is the class, whereas in AOP the unit of modularity is the aspect.
-- aspects help to modularize cross-cutting concerns.
-- cross-cutting concern: any functionality that affects multiple points of a system.
-- AOP: an alternative to Inheritance and delegation.

Scaffolding is a meta-programming method of building database-backed software applications. It
is a technique supported by some model-view-controller frameworks, in which the programmer may
 write a specification that describes how the application database may be used. The compiler
uses this specification to generate code that the application can use to create, read, update
and delete database entries, effectively treating the template as a "scaffold" on which to build
a more powerful application.
--> Scafolding is usually some type of code generation where you point it at a database, and the technology creates basic CRUD (create, read, update, delete) screens.

Metaprogramming is the writing of computer programs that write or manipulate other programs
(or themselves) as their data, or that do part of the work at compile time that would otherwise
 be done at runtime.

active record pattern
an approach to accessing data in a database. A database table or view is wrapped into a class.
 Thus, an object  instance is tied to a single row in the table. After creation of an object,
 a new row is added to the table upon save. Any object loaded gets its information from the
database. When an object is updated the corresponding row in the table is also updated. The
wrapper class implements accessor methods or properties for each column in the table or view.

continuous query
traditional query: the query result is static, represents a snapshot of db in the past.
continuous query: the query result is dynamic, updated constantly in real-time.
++ is ideal for situations in which an application repeats a particular query, and would benefit
 from always having instant access to the up-to-date result of that query.
--> a Coherence Continuous Query is a cached query result that never gets out-of-date.

oracle optimizer hints
all_rows: explicitly chooses the cost-based approach to optimize a statement block with a goal of best throughput (that is, minimum total resource consumption).
designed to minimize overall machine resources and disk I/O.
tends to favor full table scans, and is generally used in large data warehouses where immediate response time is not required.
the downside to this optimization technique that no rows from the query will be available until the entire query has been completed.
e.g. SELECT /*+ ALL_ROWS */ empno, ename, sal, job FROM emp WHERE empno = 7566;

first_rows: instruct Oracle to optimize an individual SQL statement for fast response.
 goal is to begin to return rows to the query as quickly as possible, even if it means extra disk I/O.
use index. has the downside of causing additional I/O within the database as the index nodes are accessed.
e.g. SELECT /*+ FIRST_ROWS(10) */ empno, ename, sal, job FROM emp WHERE deptno = 20;

Read-consistent queries: Queries that produce consistent results with respect to a
point in time.

read consistency (oracle)

Statement-Level Read Consistency:
all the data returned by a single query comes from a single point in time when the query began. Therefore, a query never sees 'dirty' data nor any of the changes made by transactions that commit during query execution.
-- > Guarantees that the set of data seen by a statement is consistent with respect to a single point in time and does not change during statement execution

Transaction-Level Read Consistency:
the data returned by all the queries comes from a single point in time

By default, Oracle guarantees statement-level read consistency. The set of data returned by
 a single query is consistent with respect to a single point in time. However, in some situations,
 you might also require transaction-level read consistency. This is the ability to run multiple
queries within a single transaction, all of which are read-consistent with respect to the
same point in time, so that queries in this transaction do not see the effects of
intervening committed transactions. If you want to run a number of queries against multiple tables
 and if you are not doing any updating, you prefer a read-only transaction.

aggregate:
A collection of objects that are bound together by a root entity, otherwise known as an aggregate root.
 The aggregrate root guarantees the consistency of changes being made within the aggregate by forbidding external objects from holding references to its members.
An aggregate also defines the boundary for concurrency control

    * Services: When an operation does not conceptually belong to any object. Following the natural contours of the problem, you can implement these operations in services. The Service concept is called "Pure Fabrication" in GRASP.

    * Repositories: methods for retrieving domain objects should delegate to a specialized Repository object such that alternative storage implementations may be easily interchanged.

    * Factories: methods for creating domain objects should delegate to a specialized Factory object such that alternative implementations may be easily interchanged.

Multiversion concurrency control (abbreviated MCC or MVCC),
in the database field of computer science, is a concurrency control method commonly used by database management
systems to provide concurrent access to the database and in programming languages to implement transactional memory.
For instance, a database will implement updates not by deleting an old piece of data and overwriting it with
a new one, but instead by marking the old data as obsolete and adding the newer "version."

Test-driven development
is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle:
first the developer writes a failing automated test case that defines a desired improvement or new function,
then produces code to pass that test and finally refactors the new code to acceptable standards.
++++
Test-driven development requires developers to create automated unit tests that define code requirements
(immediately) before writing the code itself. The tests contain assertions that are either true or false.
Passing the tests confirms correct behavior as developers evolve and refactor the code. Developers often
use testing frameworks, such as xUnit, to create and automatically run sets of test cases.

DMZ, or demilitarized zone is a physical or logical subnetwork that contains and exposes an
 organization's external services to a larger untrusted network, usually the Internet.
The purpose of a DMZ is to add an additional layer of security to an organization's local area network (LAN);
 an external attacker only has access to equipment in the DMZ, rather than any other part of the network.

OWSM has two ways of enforcing (or applying) security etc. for a Web Service. Oracle calls
these Policy Enforcement Points (PEPs). The two types of PEPs are called Gateways and Agents.
+++
Gateways
Runs in the OAS and acts as an proxy for all incoming requests. The Gateway inspects the request and
allows or disallows it to pass-through to the Web Service.
    * Content routing so which Web Service that is called is based on the content in the message request.
    * Do not guarantee endpoint-level security, meaning that the communication between a Gateway and a Web Service is not encrypted.
+++
Agents : security inside containers
An Agent can either run server side with the actual Web Service or client side with the Web Service client.
 It can be configured to communicate with the OWSM Policy Manager. If it is, it retrieves its security
information (the policies to enforce/apply) from the Policy Manager. If the the Policy Manager is disabled,
 then the Agent will look for a local file that contains the most recently retrieved set of security
 policies to be enforced/applied.
---------------
A client-side Agent would typically be used if the client does not support the security protocols
needed to consume Web Services -- e.g., encrypting the requests it sends (or portions of the requests),
 validating signatures on the responses it gets in return, etc. A server-side Agent would typically
 be used to guarantee endpoint-level security by, for instance, requiring requests it receives to
be digitally signed, encrypting the responses (or portions of the responses) being returned, etc.
 These are just examples of a couple of security features that the OWSM Agents support, and is not
 by any means an exhaustive list.
---------------
Gateways are easier to implement than Agents.

MVC
The model is not a database: the 'model' in MVC is both the data and the business/domain logic needed to manipulate the data in the application.
he view renders the model into a form suitable for interaction
A controller accepts input from the user and instructs the model and viewport to perform actions based on that input.
User uses controller to manipulate model, which updates the view.

General average
The law of general average is a legal principle of maritime law according to which all parties
in a sea venture proportionally share any losses resulting from a voluntary sacrifice of part of the ship or cargo to save the whole in an emergency.
In the exigencies of hazards faced at sea, crew members often have precious little time in which
to determine precisely whose cargo they are jettisoning. Thus, to avoid quarrelling that could
waste valuable time, there arose the equitable practice whereby all the merchants whose cargo
landed safely would be called on to contribute a portion, based upon a share or percentage,
to the merchant or merchants whose goods had been tossed overboard to avert imminent peril.
 While general average traces its origins in ancient maritime law, still it remains part of
the admiralty law of most countries.

linked list (when to use it)
1 . you need constant-time insertions/deletions from the list (such as in real-time computing where time predictability is absolutely critical)
2. you don't know how many items will be in the list. With arrays, you may need to re-declare and copy memory if the array grows too big
3. you don't need random access to any elements
4. you want to be able to insert items in the middle of the list (such as a priority queue)
array vs linked list
Arrays have O(1) random access, but are really expensive to add stuff onto or remove stuff from.
inked lists are really cheap to add or remove items anywhere and to iterate, but random access is O(n).

method dispatch: the process of mapping a method call to a method implementation.
--> single dispatch: a method call is dispatched based on the type of the object on which
the method is called.
--> multiple dispatch: a method call is dispatched based on multiple pieces of info (typically
the types of the arguments).

dynamic dispatch
is the process of mapping a message to a specific sequence of code (method) at runtime.
This is done to support the cases where the appropriate method cannot be determined at compile-time
(i.e. statically). Dynamic dispatch is only used for code invocation and not for other binding
 processes (such as for global variables) and the name is normally only used to describe a language
 feature where a runtime decision is required to determine which code to invoke.

A stalking horse is a person who tests a concept with someone or mounts a challenge against them on
behalf of an anonymous third party. If the idea proves viable and/or popular, the anonymous figure
 can then declare their interest and advance the concept with little risk of failure. If the concept
fails, the anonymous party will not be tainted by association and can either drop the idea completely
or bide their time and wait until a better moment for launching an attack.

stalking-horse bid
An initial bid on a bankrupt company's assets from an interested buyer chosen by the bankrupt company.
 From a pool of bidders, the bankrupt company chooses the stalking horse to make the first bid.
++
This method allows the distressed company to avoid low bids on its assets. Once the stalking horse
has made its bid, other potential buyers may submit competing bids for the bankrupt company's assets.
 In essence, the stalking horse sets the bar so that other bidders can't low-ball the purchase price.

JPA:
an API for persisting java object in a relational db.
An entity is a lightweight persistence domain object. Typically an entity represents a table in a r
elational database, and each entity instance corresponds to a row in that table. The primary programming artifact of an entity is the entity class, although entities can use helper classes.
++
The persistent state of an entity is represented either through persistent fields or persistent properties.
These fields or properties use object/relational mapping annotations to map the entities and entity relationships to the relational data in the underlying data store.

mapped superclass
A mapped superclass is not a persistent class, but allow common mappings to be defined for its subclasses.
A mapped superclass has no separate table defined for it.

JPA: setFirstResult()
The setFirstResult(N) method is used to skip the first "N"  elements from the result set.
Please note that the counting starts from 0, so if you specify 2 then first 3 records will be skipped.
JPA: setMaxResults()

Property of programming language
A property, in some object-oriented programming languages, is a special sort of class member,
intermediate between a field (or data member) and a method. Properties are read and written like fields,
 but property reads and writes are (usually) translated to get and set method calls. The field-like syntax
is said to be easier to read and write than lots of method calls, yet the interposition of method calls
allows for data validation, active updating (as of GUI visuals), and/or read-only 'fields'. That is,
 properties are intermediate between member code (methods) and member data (instance variables)
of the class, and properties provide a higher level of encapsulation than public fields.

content-addressable storage: a file is retrieved based on its contents, not its storage location.
when you store a file, the system calculates a content address, which is later used to retrieve the file.

JPA merge
Usually merge() is used in the following scenario:

    the application loads an object in the first entity manager
    the object is passed up to the presentation layer
    some modifications are made to the object
    the object is passed back down to the business logic layer
    the application persists these modifications by calling merge() in a second entity manager

Here is the exact semantic of merge():

    if there is a managed instance with the same identifier currently associated with the persistence
 context, copy the state of the given object onto the managed instance
    if there is no managed instance currently associated with the persistence context, try to load it
 from the database, or create a new managed instance
    the managed instance is returned
    the given instance does not become associated with the persistence context, it remains detached and
is usually discarded

Persist takes an entity instance, adds it to the context and makes that instance managed
(ie future updates to the entity will be tracked)

Merge creates a new instance of your entity, copies the state from the supplied entity, and makes
 the new copy managed. The instance you pass in will not be managed (any changes you make will not
 be part of the transaction - unless you call merge again).

MapReduce
map: a function that divides work and distributes it to different nodes in a cluster.
Reduce: collates the work and merges the results into a single value
---
the result of the Map computation is a list of key-value pairs
Reduce then takes each set of values that has the same key and combines them into a single value.
----
Map: Do some data processing to every element of a collection (apply the same function to
every element of a collection)
Reduce: Iterate over the collection of data produced by the Map step and summarize the results.
---
MapReduce is a programming model for parallel processing. it works by breaking the processing
into two phases: the map phase and the reduce phase.
in the map phase, the input is divided into smaller chunks and processed.
in the reduce phase, the answers from the map phase are collected and merged into a single value.
---
map: data transformation
reduce: aggregation

same-origin policy
JavaScript communications are restricted to the host serving the web page.
it means scripts loaded from one site cannot interact with scripts from other sites.
scripts loaded from one site can only communicate with that particular site.
XMLHTTPRequest object is allowed to communicate only with URLs within its own domain.

federated network identity
A network identity scheme involving multiple repositories of identities instead of a
 central logical identity repository.
--> It means linking identity information stored across multiple identity management systems.
---
network identity
An identity that is recognized throughout a network, such as the Internet or an enterprise LAN
---
Networks, whether wireless or wired, may be loosely associated and coalesced into small groups
called federations
----
Federated networks are composed of several member networks that share some level of trust,
but member networks retain their own administrative control.
===
Federated identity allows users to link identity information between accounts without centrally
 storing personal information. This enables them to have a singular authentication without having
to logon with varying usernames and passwords.

SAML eliminates the need to maintain multiple authentication credentials in multiple locations?

DHTML is a TERM for making interactive web pages.
DHTML combines HTML, JavaScript, the HTML DOM, and CSS.
what is the DOM?
   --  a tree-based model for representing HTML and XML docs
   --  a language-indepedent API for accessing elements in HTML/XML docs
   --  a w3c standard
The HTML DOM is a standard for how to get, change, add, or delete HTML elements.
The contents of a web page are available to the JS program thru a mechanism called the DOM.
The DOM is an API by which languauges (such as JS) can access the contents of a web page.
====
when the browser renders a web page, it constructs a Document Object Model, a collection of
objects that represent the HTML elements on the page.
====
HTML contents are made available to script code via an object hierarchy called DOM.
====
to make interactive web pages, you need to manipulate the HTML document in the browser.
the language for doing this is JavaScript.
To manipulate the HTML document, you manipulate the DOM.
the Document Object Model is the way JavaScript sees the browser state and the HTML page it contains.

ajax is the concept of refreshing part of a HTML document without reloading the entire page.

In mathematics, two lines or curves are orthogonal if they are perpendicular at their point of intersection.
Two vectors are orthogonal if and only if their dot product is zero.
In computer science, orthogonality has to do with the ability of a language, method, or object to vary without
side-effects. When two statistics vary independently of each other, they are considered orthogonal.

testing concepts
===
Dummy objects are passed around but never actually used. Usually they are just used to fill parameter lists.
===
Fake objects actually have working implementations, but usually take some shortcut which makes them not suitable for production (an in memory database is a good example).
Fake objects act like the real object, but they go about it in a simpler way -- such as a DAO that uses a Map to store data instead of a real database.
===
Stubs provide canned answers to calls made during the test, usually not responding at all to anything outside what's programmed in for the test. Stubs may also record information about calls, such as an email gateway stub that remembers the messages it 'sent', or maybe only how many messages it 'sent'.
Stub objects provide a valid response, but it's static -- no matter what input you pass in, you'll always get the same response.
===
Mock objects are used in mock test cases -- they validate that certain methods are called on those objects.
Mocks are what we are talking about here: objects pre-programmed with expectations which form a
specification of the calls they are expected to receive.
Mocks are like stubs on steroids. They also know which methods to call and with what arguments.
 mock objects are simulated objects that mimic the behavior of real objects in controlled ways.
--> mock object: simulate the behavior of real objects upon which some code depends.
---
stubs enable state verification. you set expectations on mock objects (like which methods will be called)
mocks enable behavior verification
--> mock: you create expectations on which methods will be called on the mock objects
--> mock: represent a series of expectations

Recursion
===
solve a problem by solving smaller instances of the same problem
===
In traditional recursion, the typical model is that you perform your recursive calls first,
and then you take the return value of the recursive call and calculate the result. In this
 manner, you don't get the result of your calculation until you have returned from every recursive call.
+++
In tail recursion, you perform your calculations first, and then you execute the recursive call,
 passing the results of your current step to the next recursive step. This results in the last
 statement being in the form of "(return (recursive-function params))" (I think that's the syntax
for Lisp). Basically, the return value of any given recursive step is the same as the return value
 of the next recursive call.
+++
Tail Recursion is a specialized type of recursion where there is a guarantee that nothing is
 left to execute in the function after a recursive call. In other words, the function returns
 the result of a recursive call.
====
A function is tail-recursive if there is nothing left to do in the function after a recursive call.
===
A compiler is said to implement tail recursion if it reuses the current stack frame instead of
creating a new stack frame.
==
tail call optimization: the ability to call a function without allocating a new stack frame.
Can only happen if the called function is in the tail position.

Database sharding: a shared-nothing, horizontal partitioning scheme for large databases.
A large database is divided into multiple smaller databases. Rows of a table are distributed
among these smaller databases.

Helper method: a method that can be called from many places to perform some task.

Wrapper class: provide a different way to access another class/object. Scenarios:
(a) to hide complexity of another class (b) to perform something in a generic way (e.g.,
 multiple serialization formats using multiple classes). Almost like a facade.

mediator pattern: an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact

modular arithmetic: where numbers wrap around after they reach a certain value -> modulus
a = b (mod n) if a-b is an integer multiple of n.
e.g., 38=14 (mod 12) ; -8=7 (mod 5) ; 2=-3 (mod 5); -3=-8 (mod 5)
if same sign, a/n and b/n have the same remainder.

remainder: a=qd+r (a=dividend, q=quotient, d=divisor, r=remainder) and |r|<|d|
that means there are two possible remainders, one negative and the other positive.
Languages choose the remainder with the same sign as the dividend/divisor.

An inferior planet (closer to the sun than Earth - Mercury and Venus) is said to be "in inferior conjunction" when
 it is directly between the Earth and the Sun. It is "in superior conjunction" when it is on the opposite side of
the Sun from the Earth. The superior planets (the six planets farther from the Sun than Earth) are "in conjunction"
when it is on the opposite side of the Sun from the Earth. A superior planet obviously cannot have an
inferior conjunction.

New moon: the phase of the moon when the moon passes between the sun and the earth
New moon (original meaning): the sighting of the first crescent (the time and date depend on the
location of the observer)

Metonic cycle: 19 years is almost exactly equal to 235 synodic months
Synodic month: the time between two new moons.

Chinese calendar: 7 intercalary months every 19 years

Network address translation: the process of modifying IP address info in a network packet
 while the packet is in transit.
Typical: enable multiple hosts on a private network to access the Internet using a single public IP address.

Port forwarding: a technique for allowing a remote computer to connect to a computer in a private network.
When configuring port forwarding, the network administrator sets aside one port number on the gateway
for the exclusive use of communicating with a service in the private network, located on a specific host.

Durian (how to choose)
1. shake it: if no sound, it is too ripe. hard knock: not ripe enough. dull, subtle knocks: just right
   should hear some slightly movement.
2. smell: neither too strong nor too raw
3. stem: very dry stem means it has been kept for a while. wet stem: fresh
4. choose one that is shapely rather than round

idempotent capability: network/hw failure can lead to lost messages. Need to resend.
May send multiple.
Design services to be idempotent: it means the system can safely accept multiple
copies of the same message.
Not all services can be idempotent (increment, decrement)
----
An idempotent HTTP method is a HTTP method that can be called many times without different outcomes.
Safe methods are HTTP methods that do not modify resources.

OOP identity: the property of an object that distinguishes it from other objects.
is whatever makes an object distinct from other objects.
What makes up the identity of an object in an object-oriented system? A common answer is "object identity" is defined by being in the same spot in memory, which is called "reference equality" and matches Java's == operator.

state object: an object that stores mutable state and is identified through reference equality
value object: is always immutable and is identified through value equality.

future/delay/promise: refer to constructs used for synchronizing in some concurrent programming languages. They
describe an object that acts as a proxy for a result that is initially unknown, usually because the
computation of its value is yet incomplete. Setting the value of a future is also called resolving,
fulfilling, or binding it.
--> a placeholder for something that you will get in the future.
---> future: an asynchronous task that computes a value for later use.
--> an object that immediately returns from an asynchronous message call. the future becomes
the result once the result is available. If you ask for the value of a future before the result
is available, the process blocks until the value is available.
--> future: a concurrency construct that allows an asynchronous return before computation is complete.
--> future: a construct that computes a value asynchronously and represents a value that will become
available in the future.
future/promise: an object that represents the result of an asynchronous function call.

coroutine: a coroutine is a subroutine or function that can pause in the middle and return a value. When you
call it again it picks up right where it was when you paused, environment intact, and keeps on going.
Coroutines are almost always closures,
--> coroutines are symmetric units that explicitly activate each other; they do not return, but
resume each other.
--> coroutines are threads that are cooperatively scheduled. they yield to each other.

Java: take a threading approach to concurrency.
A process consists of one or more threads. Threads have their own execution path but share
resources with other threads in the same process. Shared resources lead to the need for locking.
To coordinate control between applications sharing resources, threading system require semaphore
or system-level locks.
--> threads with shared resources versus shared-nothing processes.
-> thread of execution: the smallest sequence of programmed instructions that can be managed independently by an operating system scheduler.
fiber: like thread, share address space, fibers use cooperative multitasking. threads use
preemptive multitasking. Threads often depend on the kernel's thread scheduler to preempt a busy thread and
resume another thread; fibers yield themselves to run another fiber while executing.
--> fiber describe the same concept as coroutine.
that coroutines are a language-level construct, a form of control flow, while fibers are a systems-level construct, viewed as threads that happen not to run concurrently

dataflow concurrency: a variable can only be assigned once in its lifetime.
if you read a variable before it is bound, you will block until someone assigns a value to it.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Parallelism refers to physically simultaneous execution. raise your arms in parallel.
--> requires multiple processing units.
Concurrency refers to conceptually simultaneous execution. juggling 3 balls (throw/catch one ball at a time).
--> can be implemented on a single processing unit.
execution agent: the number of core/CPU.

Global interpreter lock (GIL): is a mutual exclusion lock held by a programming language interpreter
thread to avoid sharing code that is not thread-safe with other threads
Some language implementations that implement a Global Interpreter Lock are CPython, the most widely
used implementation of Python and Ruby MRI, the reference implementation of Ruby (where it is called Global VM Lock).

Typeface: A set of fonts in the same style. Or, in other words, a font family.
Ex: Times New Roman, Helvetica, or Arial.
Another acceptable way to refer to a typeface can be a font-family.
is a set of characters that share common design features.
====
Font: A single kind of typeface. Ex: Times New Roman in 10 point size is a font, and
Times New Roman in 14 point size is also a font. Times New Roman in Bold is also a font.
(Basically designating a specific type inside of a typeface is a font.)
----
Typeface is a broader term that describes the whole set and Font is the specific variation of a typeface.
====
Typesetting: the composition of text using types (or sorts: a stored letter in a mechanical system)
===
font is the delivery mechanism and a typeface is the creative work.
font is what you use, and typeface is what you see.

seizure: often used interchaneably with convulsion.
Convulsions are when a person's body shakes uncontrollably.
Seizures are episodes of disturbed brain activity that cause changes in attention or behavior.

clojure:
need to implement an abstraction for an existing , hard-to-modify object:
adapter (wrapper), monkey patch, multimethod, protocol

clojure: (defn blank? [s] (every? #(Character/isWhitespace %) s))

thread-local storage: a programming method that uses global memory local to a thread.
====
normally global variables are shared by all threads in a process. TLS is a mechanism
where each thread gets a private copy of a global variable.
----
normally all threads in a process share the same address space, which is sometimes undesirable.
In other words, data in a static or global variable is normally always located at the same memory location,
when referred to by threads from the same process. Variables on the call stack however are local to threads,
because each thread has its own stack, residing in a different memory location.
Sometimes it is desirable that two threads referring to the same static or global variable are actually
referring to different memory locations, thereby making the variable thread local, a canonical example
being the C error code variable errno.

lexical scope (also called static scoping or static scope) vs dynamic scope:
 In a lexically scoped language, the scope of an identifier is fixed at compile time to some region in
the source code containing the identifier's declaration. This means that an identifier is only accessible
within that region (including procedures declared within it).
dynamic scope: the scope depends on the nesting of functions at run time.
Perl and common lisp allow you to choose between static and dynamic scoping.
Most languages use static scoping

form follows function
the shape of an object should be based on its intended function or purpose.

Comet is a web application model in which a long-held HTTP request allows a web server to push data to a browser,
without the browser explicitly requesting it.
Comet is known by several other names, including Ajax Push, Reverse Ajax, Two-way-web, HTTP Streaming,
 and HTTP server push among others.

using a persistent or long-lasting HTTP connection between the server and the client.
The biggest hurdle is the HTTP 1.1 specification, which states that a browser should not have
more than two simultaneous connections with a web serve

referential transparency:
-- the same function with the same input will always return the same result.
a term commonly used in functional programming, means that given a function and an input value, you will always receive the same output.
With a referential transparent function, given an input and a function, you could replace it with a value instead of calling the function.
e.g., 5*5 can be replaced by 25.
referential opaqueness: Calling the function may not always produce the same output.

memoization:
a memoized function remembers the results for certain input values.
Subsequent calls with the remembered inputs will just return the remembered result
instead of recalculating it.
an optimization technique. optimized for speed in exchange for a higher use of memory.
memoization is a run-time optimization
--> means caching the result of a function/method call.
Can be done if a method always returns the same result for an input value (referential transparency).

forward proxy: takes requests from an internal network and forwards them to the internet.
reverse proxy: takes requests from the internet and forwards them to servers in an internal network.
---
Forward Proxy: Acting on behalf of a requestor (or service consumer)
Reverse Proxy: Acting on behalf of service/content producer.

static binding: the function call is mapped to the function definition at compile time.
Dynamic binding: the function call is mapped to the function definition at run time.
virtual function (C++): declare virtual function if you want dynamic binding.

lexical variable: A lexical variable is a variable that can be referenced only within the lexical scope of the form that establishes that variable; lexical variables have lexical scope. Each time a form creates a lexical binding of a variable, a fresh binding is established.

expression problem:
how do you extend existing types to new methods and extend existing methods to new types
without changing existing code
OR: how do you add new types to existing methods and add new methods to existing types
without changing existing code
--> how do you create new types implementing existing interfaces and implement new interfaces
for existing types without recompiling existing code.

A cons cell is composed of two pointers; the car operation extracts the first pointer, and the cdr operation extracts the second.
When cons cells are used to implement singly linked lists (rather than trees and other more complicated structures), the car operation returns the first element of the list, while cdr returns the rest of the list. For this reason, the operations are sometimes given the names first and rest or head and tail.

SOLID:
single responsibility principle, open/closed principle, liskov substitution principle,
interface segregation, dependency inversion.
-->
Single responsibility: a class should have only one responsibility.
Open/closed: software should be open for extension, but closed for modification (means adding new
behavior with mininum changes to existing code)
Liskov substitution: if a program module is using a Base class, then the reference to the Base class can be replaced with a Derived class without affecting the functionality of the program module.
or: if S is a subtype of T, then objects of type T may be replaced with objects of type S without changing
the correctness of the program.
or: objects of a base class can be replaced with objects of a derived class without altering the correctness
of the program.
or:  must make sure that the new derived classes just extend without replacing the functionality of old classes. Otherwise the new classes can produce undesired effects when they are used in existing program modules.
--> Derived types must be completely substitutable for their base types.
--> BEST: objects should be replaceable by their subtypes
Interface segregation: a client should not be forced to implement interfaces it does not use.
--> clients should not have to depend on abstractions they don't use.
--> it is better to have many small interfaces than one big interface.
--> BEST: small, specific interfaces are better than monolithic ones.
Dependency inversion: high-level classes should not depend on low-level classes. both should
depend on abstractions. For example: Manager class has an inst var of class Worker (bad).
Should have an inst var of interface IWorker. The Worker class implements IWorker.

Reference equality: == (java)
Value equality: equals() (java)

reification: a process by which an abstract idea is turned into an object (or data model).
example:
functional language: reify the concept of a function abstraction in the form of lambda expression.
Scheme reifies continuations
smalltalk: thisContext is a reification of the current executing block.

RDF (resource description framework): a framework for describing web resources, such
as the title, author, of a web page.

Voltaire quote: perfect is the enemy of good
Dont let the perfect be the enemy of the good

POST vs PUT:
post: not idempotent. Post to example/users since you dont know the ID of the new object and youre asking the syetem to create one.
put: idempotent. Post to example/users/1234 since you know the ID already (create or update).
--> An idempotent method means that the result of a successful performed request is independent of the number of times it is executed

a fixed point of a function is a point that is mapped to itself by the function.
a value that, when given to a function, return itself.
e.g. 1 = sqrt(1). 1 is a fixed point of the sqrt() function.
--> a fixed-point combinator is a higher-order function that computes a fixed point of other functions

turing machine: a device that manipulates symbols on a strip of tape according to some rules.

turning complete: if I say something is turing complete, it means in principle it can be used
to solve any computational problem.

formal parameter: a reference variable declared in a function definition.
actual argument: the value you pass into a function.

Wi-fi
802.11a -> 5GHz
802.11b/g -> 2.4GHz
802.11n -> 2.4 and 5GHz
2.4GHz -> used by bluetooth, microwave, remote controlled toys, etc

CAP theorem
It is impossible for a distributed computer system to simultaneously provide all three of the following guarantees:
Consistency (all nodes see the same data at the same time)
Availability (all nodes can return data at any time): A guarantee that every request to the system receives a response about whether it was successful or not.
Partition tolerance (the system continues to operate as a whole even if individual nodes cannot be reached.)

According to the theorem, a distributed system can satisfy any two of these guarantees at the
same time, but not all three

The easiest way to understand CAP is to think of two nodes on opposite sides of a partition. Allowing at
least one node to update state will cause the nodes to become inconsistent, thus forfeiting C.
Likewise, if the choice is to preserve consistency, one side of the partition must
act as if it is unavailable, thus forfeiting A. Only when nodes communicate is it possible to preserve both
consistency and availability, thereby forfeiting P.

partition tolerant: distributed
if a node is disconnected from the rest of the system and it receives a query, it has two options:
(1) answer the query (available) even though the answer may not be consistent with the rest of the system
(2) not answer the query (consistent) because the answer may not be consistent

Maintaining strict consistency in a distributed system requires a synchronous coordination of all write operations between the nodes. This principle has two unpleasant side effects: (1) it adds latencies and increases response times; (2) it reduces the overall availability because multiple members must be available at the same time to complete a write operation.

Dropping strict consistency, on the other hand, solves the availability problem and eliminates the increased response time. The basic idea is to reestablish the global consistency after completing the write operation on a subset of the nodes. This approach leaves just one problem unsolved: it is impossible to prevent conflicts if two nodes accept contradictory changes. Consistency is eventually reached by handling conflicts, not by preventing them. In that context, consistency means that all nodes have the same data, it is not necessarily the correct or best data.

Opposite of ACID:
BASE: Basically Available Soft-state wht Eventual consistency

Consistency in ACID: means that a transaction pre-serves all the database rules,
Consistency in CAP refers only to single copy consistency

aliasing: (in signal processing)
refers to an effect that causes different signals to become indistinguishable (or aliases of one another) when
sampled. It also refers to the distortion or artifact that results when the signal reconstructed from samples is
different from the original continuous signal.
related to digital audio: temporal aliasing
related to digital images: spatial aliasing

anti-aliasing:
In computer graphics, antialiasing is a software technique for diminishing jaggies - stairstep-like lines that
should be smooth. Jaggies occur because the output device, the monitor or printer, doesn't have a high enough
resolution to represent a smooth line. Antialiasing reduces the prominence of jaggies by surrounding the
stairsteps with intermediate shades of gray (for gray-scaling devices) or color (for color devices).
Although this reduces the jagged appearance of the lines, it also makes them fuzzier.
--> spatial anti-aliasing:
the technique of minimizing aliasing when representing a high-resolution image at a lower resolution

POSIX (Portable Operating System Interface for UNIX)
a standard that defines an interface between programs and Unix-like operating systems.
the purpose is to make it easier to port programs between systems.

prototype language: JavaScript, Io, Lua, Self
--> use the object, rather than the class, as the basis for object definition

string vs symbol:
2 strings with the same value can be 2 different objects in memory.
2 symbols with the same value always refer to the same object in memory.
String: used to hold data
symbol: used to name things
symbol: an identifier consisting of a string of characters.
Symbols are used to represent names.
you can have multiple string objects with the same value.
you cannot have multiple symbol objects with the same value.

power set: a set of all the subsets of a set.
if set is {a,b,c},
then power set is { {}, {a}, {b}, {c}, {a, b}, {a, c}, {b, c}, {a, b, c} }
the power set has 2^n members

library vs framework:
a library is a set of functions you can call.
library: you are in control. you call the library.
framework: fwk is in control. fwk calls your code.

ClassNotFoundException:
thrown when you try to load a class using its string name and the class cannot be found
--> Class:forName(), ClassLoader.findSystemClass(), ClassLoader.loadClass()
NoClassDefFoundError:
Thrown if the Java Virtual Machine or a ClassLoader instance tries to load in the definition of a class (as part of a normal method call or as part of creating a new instance using the new expression) and no definition of the class could be found. also static initializer. also class visibility problem between class loaders.
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: com/cheok/C

Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: com.cheok.C

graceful degradation:
web page is designed for a particular browser version and would remain presentable or degrade if
older versions of browsers are used.
=====
start with modern browsers and provide workaround for older browsers.

progressive enhancement:
the opposite of graceful degradation.
divide a web application into 3 components: HTML (structure), CSS (presentation), JavaScript (behavior)
--> a web design strategy that emphasizes accessibility to all devices, using a layered approach.
a basic HTML doc is created, geared towards the lowest common denominator of browser s/w functionality.
---
start with older browsers and add new features for modern browsers.

semantic HTML
Semantic HTML is the use of HTML markup to reinforce the semantics, or meaning, of the information in
webpages rather than merely to define its presentation (look). Semantic HTML is processed by regular web
browsers as well as by many other user agents. CSS is used to suggest its presentation to human users.
As an example, recent HTML standards discourage use of the tag <i> in preference of more specific tags
such as <em> (emphasis); the CSS stylesheet should then specify whether emphasis is denoted by an italic
font, a bold font, underlining, slower or louder audible speech etc. This is because italics are used for
purposes other than emphasis,
--> should not use presentational HTML markup such as <i>, <font>, etc

race condition
multiple threads access a resource at the same time, leading to unpredictable results.

imperative programming: you tell the computer exactly how to do a job.

binding: the process of assigning parameters based on the inbound arguments.
destructuring: binding a set of variables to a corresponding set of values.
--> you take apart a data structure and grab only the pieces that are important to you.

fail-fast vs fail-safe
fail-fast Iterators fail as soon as they realized that structure of Collection has been changed since
iteration has begun. Structural changes means adding, removing or updating any element from
collection while one thread is Iterating over that collection. fail-fast behavior is implemented by
keeping a modification count and if iteration thread realizes the change in modification count it
throws ConcurrentModificationException.
Iterators returned by most of JDK1.4 collection are fail-fast including Vector, ArrayList, HashSet etc
--
fail-safe iterator doesn't throw any Exception if Collection is modified structurally
while one thread is Iterating over it because they work on clone of Collection instead of original
collection and thats why they are called as fail-safe iterator. Iterator of CopyOnWriteArrayList is an
example of fail-safe Iterator also iterator written by ConcurrentHashMap keySet is also fail-safe iterator
and never throw ConcurrentModificationException in Java.

project management triangle
aka triple constraint. cost, scope, time
pick any two: fast, good, cheap

buffer overflow
a program, when writing data to a buffer, overruns the buffer's boundary and overwrites
adjacent memory. C/C++ has no built-in protection against buffer overflow.
they do not check that data written to a buffer is within the boundaries of that buffer.

segmentation fault: means a program tries to access a memory location that it
is not allowed to access.
---
Segmentation Fault (also known as SIGSEGV and is usually signal 11):
  You can get this message when the program tries to write/read outside the memory allocated for it or when writing memory which can only be read.
Bus Error (also known as SIGBUS and is usually signal 10) -
  You can encounter this signal error when an invalid pointer is dereferenced i.e when you try to dereference an uninitialised pointer. It is similar to SIGSEGV but the difference is that SIGSEGV indicates an invalid access to valid memory, while SIGBUS indicates an access to an invalid address.

too far in the future

semantic web: attach meaning to the services and information on the web.

ordered array: fast searching, slow insertion/deletion
linked list: slow searching, fast insertion/deletion
tree: fast searching and fast insertion/deletion: O(logN)

spatial locality
1. data has spatial locality if it is located close together in memory.
2. data/instruction close to recently accessed data/instruction are likely to be
accessed in the near future.
3. the use of data/resource within relatively close storage locations.
4. the use of data that are located close to one another.
5. resources that are near one another are likely to be accessed close together in time.
temporal locality
1. data has temporal locality if it is accessed at roughly the same time. (or recently accessed)
2. recently accessed data/instruction are likely to be accessed again in the near future.
3. the reuse of data/resource within a short time.
locality of reference = spatial locality and temporal locality
--> refers to the same data or related storage locations being frequently accessed.
--> Programs tend to reuse data and instructions they have used recently.

tuple: a fixed-length set of objects
tuple: an ordered list of elements (like an ordered collection)

In OOP, need to handle this problem: an object can have several different roles.
C++: multiple inheritance
Java: interface
Ruby: mixin
Scala: trait

dark moon: moon is directly between the sun and the earth. moon is invisible from earth.
new moon: first crescent (depends on location of observer).
beginning of islamic, hebrew, hindu calendar month: new moon
beginning of chinese calendar month: dark moon
dark moon comes before new moon. chinese 1 comes before islamic 1.

functional programming
1. programs are made up of functions
2. a function always returns a value
3. a function given the same input will always return the same value
3. functional programs avoid changing state or mutating data (immutability).
--> functioinal programming: emphasizes the evaluation of function and immutability
--> functional programming is programming without assignment statements.
best practices:
a function must take at least one argument
a function must return data or another function
no loop
---
how you divide up a problem depends on how you put the solutions together.
FP: provides two new kinds of glue: higher-order functions and lazy evaluation.
allow greatly improved modularization
functions that are indivisible in conventional languages can be expressed as a
combination of functions.
lazy evaluation: g(f(x)): g() and f() are run in synchronization.
f() is only started when g() tries to read some input, and only run long
enough to deliver the output g() is trying to read. Then f() is suspended and g() is run
until it tries to read another input. f() is terminated as soon as g() is terminated.
f() can be a non-terminating function.
--> delaying execution until the value is needed

list comprehension:
a syntactic construct for creating a list based on existing lists.
Smalltalk example: ((1 to: 100) select: [:x|x*x>3]) collect: [:x|2*x]
--> follows the form of set comprehension:
a mathematical notation for describing a set by stating the properties that its members must satisfy.

call with current continuation: (call/cc)
(call/cc F): takes one argument F
F is expected to be a function that takes one argument C.
C represents the current continuation. C is a function that takes one argument.
Invoking C in F will force execution of the program to jump to the point where call/cc was called.
The argument to C is the return value of call/cc.
---
continuation: allow you to save the execution state of your program and later return to the same point.

--> call-with-current-continuation allows you to save the state of a computation, package it up as a data structure, and go off and do something else. Whenever you want, you can restore the old saved state, abandoning the current computation and and picking up where the saved computation left off.
--> allows you to implement advanced control structures such as backtracking, cooperative multitasking, and custom exception-handling.

backtracking: a general algorithm for finding all (or some) solutions to some computational problem, that
incrementally builds candidates to the solutions, and abandons each partial candidate c ("backtracks")
as soon as it determines that c cannot possibly be completed to a valid solution
--> an attempt to re-satisfy the last satisfied goal when the next goal fails.

--> Securitization is the financial practice of pooling various types of contractual debt such as residential mortgages, commercial mortgages, auto loans or credit card debt obligations and selling said consolidated debt as bonds, pass-through securities, or Collateralized mortgage obligation (CMOs), to various investors. The principal and interest on the debt, underlying the security, is paid back to the various investors regularly.
--> An asset-backed security is a security whose value and income payments are derived from and collateralized (or "backed") by a specified pool of underlying assets. The pool of assets is typically a group of small and illiquid assets that are unable to be sold individually. Pooling the assets into financial instruments allows them to be sold to general investors, a process called securitization, and allows the risk of investing in the underlying assets to be diversified because each security will represent a fraction of the total value of the diverse pool of underlying assets.
--> a mortgage-backed security (MBS) is an asset-backed security that represents a claim on the cash flows from mortgage loans through a process known as securitization.

pangram: a sentence that uses every letter of the alphabet at least once.
e.g. the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.

deadlock: a situation in which two or more competing actions are each waiting for the other to finish, and
thus neither ever does. processes are stuck due to circular dependencies.
livelock: similar to a deadlock, except that the states of the processes involved in the livelock constantly
change with regard to one another, none progressing
--
Deadlock describes a situation where two or more threads are blocked forever, waiting for each other.
--
Starvation describes a situation where a thread is unable to gain regular access to shared resources and is unable to make progress.

closure: anonymous functions with closed scope
it carries around the context in which it was defined.
a block can reference the variables that were in scope when it was defined,
even if those variables later go out of scope.

jumbo loan: a loan above the conforming loan limit.
the conforming loan limit is set by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which are
government-sponsored enterprises that purchase residential mortgages from
banks, allowing them to free up money to lend more mortgages.

aspect-oriented programming (AOP): allow separation of cross-cutting concerns (logging, transaction,
security, persistence). In OO code, a behavior is often repeated in multiple classes or spread
across multiple methods. AOP allows you to abstract this behavior and apply it to classes and methods
without using inheritance.

homoiconicity: Expressing the language in its own data structures
code is represented using its own data structure
Lisp code, its textual representation, is written in the same format as its internal representation (AST). Such a property is called homoiconicity,

quine: a program that prints its own source code.

liar paradox: "this sentence is false"
Quine's paradox: "Yields falsehood when preceded by its quotation" yields falsehood when preceded by its quotation.

hygienic marco: means that variables defined within macro code are renamed, or subject to some other transformation, in order to avoid name clashes with the code surrounding the macro call site.

knapsack problem: a problem in combinatorial optimization: Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible. It derives its name from the problem faced by someone who is constrained by a fixed-size knapsack and must fill it with the most valuable items.
--> Combinatorial optimization is a topic that consists of finding an optimal object from a finite set of objects.
--> we have a knapsack with a limited capacity. we have a number of items, each of which has a weight
and a value. the problem is put one or more items in the knapsack such that the we have the maximum value
without exceeding the capacity of the knapsack.
====
knapsack problem: Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the number of each item to
include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the
total value is as large as possible.
example: given a set of boxes with a weight and an amount of money, which boxes should be chosen to
maximize the amount of money while still keeping the overall weight under or equal to 15 kg?

clojure: persistent data structure: means that the data structure is immutable, yet has efficient
non-destructive operations that correspond to the operations on the classical hash table. The word
efficient means on par with their mutating counterparts.

time complexity: quantifies the amount of time taken by an algorithm.
--> quantifies the running time of an algorithm based on the size of the dataset.
commonly expressed using the big O notation.
constant time: O(1)
linear time: O(n)
logarithmic time: O(log n)
polynomial time: O(n^k). quicksort: O(n^2). Most familiar mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as computing square roots, powers, and logarithms, can be performed in polynomial time. Computing the digits of most interesting mathematical constants, including pi and e, can also be done in polynomial time.
--> Non-deterministic turing machine: A nondeterministic Turing machine is a "parallel" Turing machine that can take many computational paths simultaneously, with the restriction that the parallel Turing machines cannot communicate.
--> NP-problem: A problem is assigned to the NP (nondeterministic polynomial time) class if it is solvable in polynomial time by a nondeterministic Turing machine.
--> NP-hard: A problem is NP-hard if an algorithm for solving it can be translated into one for solving any NP-problem (nondeterministic polynomial time) problem. NP-hard therefore means "at least as hard as any NP-problem," although it might, in fact, be harder.
--> NP-Complete : A problem which is both NP (verifiable in nondeterministic polynomial time) and NP-hard (any NP-problem can be translated into this problem). Examples of NP-hard problems include the Hamiltonian cycle and traveling salesman problems.
Big O: upper bound, worst case
Big Omega: lower bound, best case
Big Theta: when best and worst case are the same, can use Big Theta
these are called asymptotic functions: because they capture the growth of a function
as its argument asymptotically approaches infinity.

in-place algorithm: uses a small constant amount of extra space, usually overwrites the input space.

python generator: a function that generates a sequence of values instead of a single value.
--> a function that stops in the middle, returns a value to the caller, and later on
picks up where it left off.
Generators decouple iteration from the code that uses the results of the iteration
The function only executes on next()
yield produces a value, but suspends the function
Function resumes on next call to next()
One of the most powerful applications of generators is setting up processing pipelines
When you call a coroutine, nothing happens
They only run in response to next() and send()

compiler: translate source code into machine language
linker: combines multiple object files into an an executable program.

abstract data type: defined by the operations that may be performed on it and its implementation is hidden.

Von Neumann architexture: memory that contains data and instructions; and a processing unit.
processing unit takes instruction and data out of memory, manipuate the data and store the result
to some memory cells. Repeat.
two characteristics: sequential step-by-step execution of instructions and mutable data.

orthogonality: means that any composition of the basic primitives should be allowed. This would
achive the greatest degree of generality.

Dunning-Kruger effect: is a cognitive bias in which unskilled individuals suffer from illusory superiority, mistakenly rating their ability much higher than average.
--> the miscalibration of the incompetent stems from an error about the self, whereas the miscalibration of the highly competent stems from an error about others
--> when incompetent people not only fail to realise their incompetence, but consider themselves much more competent than everyone else. Basically, they're too stupid to know that they're stupid.
--> the incompetent overestimate their ability.
--> the competent underestimate their ability.
--> a little knowledge is a dangerous thing

In a web browser, an access key or accesskey allows a computer user immediately to jump to a specific part of a web page via the keyboard.

first sale doctrine: the purchaser of a copyrighted work can resell or give away or destroy the copyrighted work
without the permission of the copyright owner.

currying: converting a function that takes multiple arguments into a chain of functions that take one argument.
currying vs partial application
--> Where partial application takes a function and from it builds a function which takes fewer arguments, currying builds functions which take multiple arguments by composition of functions which each take a single argument.

Java web application: model 1 vs model 2 (two usage patterns for JSP pages)
Model 1: logic is contained within JSP pages.
-->
Model 2 JSP programming
1. requests from browsers are passed to the controller (servlet)
2. controller obtains the correct content for display (from model (POJO, beans))
3. controller then passes content to a view (JSP pages)
4. view renders the content
In model 2, logic is in servlet. JSP only renders the content.
--> Model 1 and Model 2 simply refer to the absence or presence (respectively) of a controller servlet that dispatches requests from the client tier and selects views.

association list: a list where each node is a key-value pair. like a dictionary. search is O(n)

setuid, setgid: allow users to execute a program with the access rights of the program's owner or group.
Normally, the permission rights of a process is the same as the user who executes the process.
setuid/setgid allow users to execute programs with temporarily elevated privileges in order to
perform a specific task.
Needed for tasks that require higher privileges.
The user who executes the program gains the privileges of the user who owns the program.
-->
Setting the setgid permission on a directory (chmod g+s) causes new files and subdirectories created within it to
inherit its group ID, rather than the primary group ID of the user who created the file (the owner ID is never
affected, only the group ID). Newly created subdirectories inherit the setgid bit.
---
unix: setuid bit, setgid bit, sticky bit
sticky bit: chmod +x <dirname> : a file in the dir can only be deleted/renamed by the owner of the file,
or the owner of the directory, or superuser
---
sticky bit: set on a directory.
if it is set, the only user who can rename or remove any file is the file's owner, the directory's owner,
or superuser.
--> Normally, if you have write permssion for a directory, you can rename or remove files not owned by you.

federated database:
a system in which several databases appear to function as a single entity. Each component database in the system is completely self-sustained and functional. When an application queries the federated database, the system figures out which of its component databases contains the data being requested and passes the request to it. Federated databases can be thought of as database virtualization in much the same way that storage virtualization makes several drives appear as one.

-- network gateway
A gateway is a network point that acts as an entrance to another network. On the Internet, a node or stopping point can be either a gateway node or a host (end-point) node. Both the computers of Internet users and the computers that serve pages to users are host nodes. The computers that control traffic within your company's network or at your local Internet service provider (ISP) are gateway nodes.
In the network for an enterprise, a computer server acting as a gateway node is often also acting as a proxy server and a firewall server. A gateway is often associated with both a router, which knows where to direct a given packet of data that arrives at the gateway, and a switch, which furnishes the actual path in and out of the gateway for a given packet.
proxy server: receive a request from a computer, request a page from a server on the internet,
then forwards it to the user.
firewall: prevent outsiders from accessing a private network and control what outside resources
firewall: a barrier that controls what kind of data comes into and out of your network
users can access
-- SOCKS
a protocol that a proxy server can use to accept requests from client users in a company's network so that it can forward them across the Internet.
is a network protocol designed to allow clients to communicate with Internet servers through firewalls.

CMS vs RDBMS (like car vs diesel engine)
CMS is a full-blown system allowing end-users to view and modify content (articles, media, etc.) in an easy way.

hard link: cannot create a hard link to a directory. cannot cross a file system.

OSI model: a conceptual model that defines the internal functions of a communications system by partitioning
it into seven layers. think of the layers as an assembly line. At each layer, certain things happen
to the data that prepare it for the next layer.
Application set: layer 5,6,7. transport set: 1,2,3,4
Layer 7 (application): this layer interacts with the OS.
layer 6 (presentation): Layer 6 takes the data provided by the Application layer and converts it into a standard format that the other layers can understand
layer 5 (session): Layer 5 establishes, maintains and ends communication with the receiving device.
layer 4 (transport): This layer maintains flow control of data and provides for error checking and recovery of data between the devices. Flow control means that the Transport layer looks to see if data is coming from more than one application and integrates each application's data into a single stream for the physical network.
layer 3 (network): The way that the data will be sent to the recipient device is determined in this layer. Logical protocols, routing and addressing are handled here.
layer 2 (data link): In this layer, the appropriate physical protocol is assigned to the data. Also, the type of network and the packet sequencing is defined.
layer 1 (physical): This is the level of the actual hardware. It defines the physical characteristics of the network such as connections, voltage levels and timing.

TCP/IP:
Layer 1: Network Interface - This layer combines the Physical and Data layers and routes the data between devices on the same network. It also manages the exchange of data between the network and other devices.
Layer 2: Internet - This layer corresponds to the Network layer. The Internet Protocol (IP) uses the IP address, consisting of a Network Identifier and a Host Identifier, to determine the address of the device it is communicating with.
Layer 3: Transport - Corresponding to the OSI Transport layer, this is the part of the protocol stack where the Transport Control Protocol (TCP) can be found. TCP works by asking another device on the network if it is willing to accept information from the local device.
Layer 4: Application - Layer 4 combines the Session, Presentation and Application layers of the OSI model. Protocols for specific functions such as e-mail (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, SMTP) and file transfer (File Transfer Protocol, FTP) reside at this level.

discretionary access control (DAC)
a means of restricting access to objects based on the identity of subjects and/or groups to which they belong.
the subject can change the permissions of objects.
example: unix user and group id
--> Mandatory Access Control (MAC) is a type of access control in which only the administrator manages the access controls. The administrator defines the usage and access policy, which cannot be modified or changed by users, and the policy will indicate who has access to which programs and files.
--> mandatory access control (MAC) refers to a type of access control by which the operating system constrains the ability of a subject or initiator to access or generally perform some sort of operation on an object or target.
--> Role-based access control (RBAC) is a method of regulating access to computer or network resources based on the roles of individual users within an enterprise. In this context, access is the ability of an individual user to perform a specific task, such as view, create, or modify a file. Roles are defined according to job competency, authority, and responsibility within the enterprise.

autoboxing: automatic conversion from primitive types to object wrapper classes.

baseband: means a single signal is transmitted.
broadband: transmitting multiple signals.

A packet and a frame are both packages of data moving through a network.
frame: exists at Layer 2 of the OSI Model. (data link layer)
packet:  exists at Layer 3 of the OSI Model, (network layer)

store-and-forward:  information is sent to an intermediate station where it is kept and sent at a later time to the final destination or to another intermediate station.
cut-through: method for packet switching systems, wherein the switch starts forwarding a frame (or packet) before the whole frame has been received, normally as soon as the destination address is processed

liveness: A concurrent application's ability to execute in a timely manner is known as its liveness.

crossing the memory barrier (java):
the copying of data from local memory (registers/cache) to main memory and vice versa.
when? synchronized, volatile,

java synchronized:
When one thread is executing a synchronized method for an object, all other threads that invoke synchronized methods for the same object block (suspend execution) until the first thread is done with the object.
--when a synchronized method exits, it automatically establishes a happens-before relationship with any subsequent invocation of a synchronized method for the same object. This guarantees that changes to the state of the object are visible to all threads.
----
happens-before relationship:
is a guarantee that memory written to by statement A is visible to statement B, that is, that statement A completes its write before statement B starts its read
Memory consistency errors occur when different threads have inconsistent views of what should be the same data.
---
a guarantee that state changes made by one thread is visible to all threads.
---
happened-before relationship  is a guarantee that memory written to by statement A is visible to statement B,
that is, that statement A completes its write before statement B starts its read
---
In concurrent programming, a monitor is a synchronization construct that allows threads to have both mutual exclusion and the ability to wait (block) for a certain condition to become true. Monitors also have a mechanism for signalling other threads that their condition has been met.
--
monitor : a construct that allows threads to gain exclusive access to an object. it also allows threads to wait (block) for a certain
condition and to signal other threads that the condition has been met.
 supports two kinds of thread synchronization: mutual exclusion and cooperation
----
Synchronization is built around an internal entity known as the intrinsic lock or monitor lock.
Every object has an intrinsic lock associated with it. By convention, a thread that needs exclusive and consistent access to an object's fields has to acquire the object's intrinsic lock before accessing them, and then release the intrinsic lock when it's done with them.
--
When a thread invokes a synchronized method, it automatically acquires the intrinsic lock for that method's object and releases it when the method returns.
---
Allowing a thread to acquire the same lock more than once enables reentrant synchronization.
-- java synchronized keyword:
The memory representation in different threads of the object being locked is being synchronized.
after the synchronized block is completed, all changes made to the locked object are flushed
to main memory before the lock is released.
before the synchronized block is entered, all changes to the locked object are read in from main
memory.
--> volatile keyword:
the value seen by a thread is always re-read from main memory before use.
any changed value is flushed to main memory before the instruction is completed.
--
The java.lang.Thread.join() method waits for this thread to die.
the Java wait/notify mechanism is essentially a way to communicate between threads.
wait(): release the lock and the thread is suspended.
wait() is used when you are waiting for some condition that is under the control of another thread.
Once notification arrives, the JVM wakens the waiting thread, which then tries to reacquire the lock.
wait() and notify() must be called from a synchronized context to avoid a potential race condition:
the notify() comes before the wait(). and the waiting thread waits forever.
race condition detail:
Thread A tests a condition and discovers it must wait.
Thread B sets the condition and calls notify() to inform A to resume execution. Because A is not yet waiting, nothing happens.
Thread A waits, by calling wait().
Because of the prior notify() call, A waits indefinitely.
---> wait() and notify() compete for the same lock.
--
synchronized method: acquire the monitor for the method's object.
static synchronized method: acquire the monitor for the Class object.

In cryptography, a one-time pad is a system in which a private key generated randomly is used only once to encrypt a message that is then decrypted by the receiver using a matching one-time pad and key.
--
work by adding a set of random digits to a message thereby creating a ciphertext that looks random to any eavesdropper. The receiver decodes the message by taking away the same set of random digits to reveal the original message.
--
 a crypto algorithm where plaintext is combined with a random key. It is the only known method to perform mathematically unbreakable encryption.
---
requirements:
The key is at least as long as the message or data that must be encrypted.
The key is truly random (not generated by a simple computer function or such)
Key and plaintext are calculated modulo 10 (digits), modulo 26 (letters) or modulo 2 (binary)
Each key is used only once, and both sender and receiver must destroy their key after use.
There should only be two copies of the key: one for the sender and one for the receiver (some exceptions exist for multiple receivers)

transaction isolation level
Serializable, Repeatable read (phantom read problem), Read committed (non-repeatable read problem),
Read uncommitted (dirty read problem)
--
non-repeatable read: during a transaction, you get different results when you read a row multiple times.
phantom read: during a transaction, you get different result sets when you execute a query multiple times.
===
oracle isolation level:
Read Committed Isolation Level :  every query executed by a transaction sees only data committed before the query
began.
Serializable Isolation Level: a transaction sees only changes committed at the time the transaction began.
A serializable transaction operates in an environment that makes it appear as if no other users were modifying data in the database.

certificate authority, or certification authority (CA), is an entity that issues digital certificates.
a root certificate is either an unsigned public key certificate or a self-signed certificate that identifies the Root Certificate Authority (CA)
Digital certificates are verified using a chain of trust. The trust anchor for the digital certificate is the Root Certificate Authority (CA).

public key certificate
an electronic document that uses a digital signature to bind a public key with an identity
--> The certificate can be used to verify that a public key belongs to an individual.
In a typical public key infrastructure (PKI) scheme, the signature will be of a certificate authority (CA). In a web of trust scheme, the signature is of either the user (a self-signed certificate) or other users ("endorsements"). In either case, the signatures on a certificate are attestations by the certificate signer that the identity information and the public key belong together.
--
digital signature:
demonstrate the authenticity of a message.  A valid digital signature gives a recipient reason to believe that the message was created by a known sender, such that the sender cannot deny having sent the message (authentication and non-repudiation) and that the message was not altered in transit (integrity).
-- first : generate private key and a corresponding public key.
-- A signing algorithm that, given a message and a private key, produces a signature.
-- A signature verifying algorithm that, given a message, public key and a signature, either accepts or rejects the message's claim to authenticity.

A trapdoor function is a function that is easy to compute in one direction, yet believed to be difficult to compute in the opposite direction (finding its inverse) without special information, called the "trapdoor". Trapdoor functions are widely used in cryptography.

RDBMS: set-theory-based system implemented as two-dimensinal tables with rows and columns.
relation: table
tuple: row
attribute: column

window functions (oracle: analytic functions):
-> select dnd_record_id, avg(usage_days) over(partition by dnd_record_id), usage_days from shp_dnd_record;
window function results do not collapse results per group.

NoSQL:
columnar (column-oriented) db: data from a given column is stored together.
beneficial when you access many rows but only a few columns.
by contrast: in RDBMS , data from a given row is stored together

SQL injection: a vulnerability that occurs when a web app takes data from the users and include it
in an SQL statement without first validating the data.
cross-site scripting: a vulnerability that occurs when a web app takes data from the users and dynamically include it
in web pages without first validating the data.

don't remove positive first: if the tool comes into contact with the terminal and the car: short circuit
installing car battery: opposite of removal: positive first.

ThreadLocal:
every thread that accesses a ThreadLocal variable via its get or set method has its own, independently initialized copy of the variable
ThreadLocal is a Java class which make instance variable of a class as local to a thread.

queue starvation:
Its a problem that can occur when scheduling tasks in priority queues if there are too many high priority tasks
so that lower priority tasks never get scheduled and are just waiting indefinitely. For example, lets say we
have three queues: high, medium and low priority. Tasks in the high priority one always get processed first.
Once this queue is empty the tasks from the medium priority queue get processed. Of course the tasks in the
low priority queue get processed only if the other two queues are empty. If there are too many high and
medium priority tasks incoming all the time so that the queues never get empty, then the low priority tasks
are not processed at all.
-- If high priority processes use up a lot of CPU time, lower priority processes may starve and be
postponed indefinitely. The situation where a process never gets scheduled to run is called starvation

API vs SPI (service provider interface)
API: API is the description of classes/interfaces/methods/... that you call and use to achieve a goal
SPI: SPI is the description of classes/interfaces/methods/... that you extend and implement to achieve a goal

REST principles:
addressable resource: items are accessible through URI
uniform interface: resources are accessed using the standard HTTP verbs: GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE
content negotiation: the client can request different representations of resources, using MIME types
stateless services
HATEOAS: hypermedia/hypertest as the engine of application state: hypertest should be used to find
your way thru the API. The response contains links.
GET: safe and idempotent
PUT and DELETE: idempotent but not safe
POST: not safe and not idempotent

assertion: used to validate that an expected condition is true.

AST: an in-memory representation of source code.

An Internet hosting service is a service that runs Internet servers, allowing organizations and individuals to serve content to the Internet.
A common kind of hosting is web hosting.
----
A virtual private server (VPS) is a virtual machine sold as a service by an Internet hosting service.
A VPS runs its own copy of an operating system, and customers have superuser-level access to that operating system instance, so they can install almost any software that runs on that OS. For many purposes they are functionally equivalent to a dedicated physical server,

wire-level protocol is a description of the format of the data that is sent across the network as a stream of octets

oracle execution plan:
access predicate: we are using something to "access" the data - we only "access" relevant data.
In general - you'll see "access" when using an index for example. We are using the index to "access" only the rows of interest.
filter predicate: we are getting more data then we need, and we filter it after we get it.

DB join:
A join combines the output from exactly two row sources, such as tables or views, and returns one row source. The returned row source is the data set.

A join condition compares two row sources using an expression. The join condition defines the relationship between the tables. If the statement does not specify a join condition, then the database performs a Cartesian join (see "Cartesian Joins"), matching every row in one table with every row in the other table.

In general, nested loops joins work best on small tables with indexes on the join conditions.

The optimizer always tries to put the smallest row source first, making it the driving table.
nested loop:
 The optimizer determines the driving table and designates it as the outer table.
 The other table is designated as the inner table.
 For every row in the outer table, Oracle accesses all the rows in the inner table. The outer loop is for every row in the outer table and the inner loop is for every row in the inner table. The outer loop appears before the inner loop in the execution plan, as follows:
--> fetch the result from one table and query the other table for each row from the first

NESTED LOOPS
  outer_loop
  inner_loop

hash join: A method for joining large data sets. The database uses the smaller of two data sets to build a hash table on the join key in memory. It then scans the larger data set, probing the hash table to find the joined rows.
The indexing strategy for a hash join is very different because there is no need to index the join columns. Only indexes for independent where predicates improve hash join performance.
--> build a hash table from the samller data set, then for each row in the larger data set, probe the hash table for a match.
Hash joins can not look up rows from the inner (probed) row source based on values retrieved from the outer (driving) row source, nested loops can.
When joining table A and B (A being driving table and B being the probed table), then hash joins can not perform index lookups into table B based on the values returned from table A

java volatile keyword: Reads and writes are atomic for all variables declared volatile (including long and double variables).
--> indicate the var will be modified by multiple threads.
--> the values will always be read from main memory.

Both CyclicBarrier and CountDownLatch are used to implement a scenario where one Thread waits for one or more Thread to complete there job before starts processing but there is one Difference between CountDownLatch and CyclicBarrier in Java which separates them apart and that is, you can not reuse same CountDownLatch instance once count reaches to zero and latch is open, on the other hand CyclicBarrier can be reused by resetting Barrier, Once barrier is broken.

Docker is a container virtualization technology that offers the promise of a more efficient, lightweight approach to application deployment than most organizations are currently implementing. With a traditional virtualization hypervisor like VMware ESX, Microsoft Hyper-V or the open-source Xen and Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) technologies, each virtual machine (VM) needs its own operating system. In contrast, with Docker, applications sit inside a container that resides on a single host operating system, that can serve many containers.
--  hypervisor abstracts an entire device, containers just abstract the operating system kernel.
-- container: share OS, and where applicable, bins/libraries
-- developers can use Docker to pack, ship, and run any application as a lightweight, portable, self sufficient LXC container that can run virtually anywhere
-- It can get more applications running on the same hardware than other technologies; it makes it easy for developers to quickly create, ready-to-run containered applications; and it makes managing and deploying applications much easier

SQL union vs union all
union concatenates the results of two SQL queries:
example:
--
select ref_num from shp_dnd_record where ref_num = '51X4JM9'
union all select category from shp_dnd_detail where dnd_record_id = 6373409;
--
union : remove duplicates
union all: does not remove duplicates
---
Union vs full outer join:
Union is vertical - rows from table1 followed by rows from table2 (distinct for union, all for union all)
and both table must have same number of columns with compatible datatypes.
Full outer join is horizontal. Number of rows in full outer join is max of table1 and table 2 rows and number of columns = table1 columns + table2 columns.

bit mask: a value used with bit-wise operators to test, set, or reset the state of individual bits in a bit-wise field value.
bit vector: a data structure which compactly stores individual bits (boolean values).
mask: A filter that selectively includes or excludes certain values.

SLA: A contract between a service provider and a customer that specifies the customer's requirements and the provider's commitments.

Thread-safe: A piece of code is thread-safe if it is reentrant or protected from multiple simultaneous executions by some form of mutual exclusion.
A piece of code is reentrant if it functions correctly during simultaneous execution by multiple threads.
A subroutine is reentrant, and thus thread-safe, if it only uses variables from the stack, depends only on the arguments passed in,
and only calls other subroutines with similar properties.
Thread-safety can be achieved through: (a) reentrancy (b) mutual exclusion (c) thread-local storage (d) atomic operations.
Thread safety means that an object always maintains a valid state, even when used concurrently by multiple threads. Safe for use by multiple threads.

Instrumentation: the insertion of additional code into a program in order to collect information about program behavior during program execution.
Useful for dynamic analysis techniques such as assertion checking, coverage analysis, tuning.

Assertion: an expression, if false, indicates an error.

Scalability:
The ability of a system to accommodate growth.
Scalability measures the ability of a system to deliver consistent performance while the workload increases

diamond problem: the ambiguity that can result from multiple inheritance.

generalization: a relationship between a thing and a more specific kind of that thing.

container (or wrapper) format: define how to store things within them, not what kind of data is stored
a metafile format whose specification describes how different elements of data and metadata coexist in a computer file.
--> a metadata format that describes how to store different data elements in a computer file.
--> does not describe how data is encoded.
therefore, a program may be able to identify and open a container file, but it
might not be able to decode the contained data. This may be caused by the program lacking the required decoding algorithm.
example container formats: MPEG-4 (.mp4), Flash (.flv), Ogg (.ogv), WebM (.webm), Audio Video Interleave (.avi)

continuous deployment: every check-in is deployed to production.

fork-join paradigm:
In parallel computing, the fork–join model is a way of setting up and executing parallel programs,
such that execution branches off in parallel at designated points in the program, to "join" (merge) at a subsequent point and resume sequential execution.

koan (software):
a demonstration of a feature with something missing.
you provide the missing value to make the test case pass.
A koan is a small snippet of almost-correct code,

functor
A functor is a mapping between two categories that preserves their structure.
an example of a functor is the "map" function that turns a list of objects into another list by applying a function to each of its elements.
In Haskell, and in some related pure functional language, Functor is a type class. A type belongs to a type class (or more technically, the type "is an instance of" the type class) when the type provides certain operations with certain expected behavior. A type T can belong to class Functor if it has certain collection-like behavior:
monad
a pure functional program has these characteristics: executed in no particular order, no side effects, stateless.
but sometimes we need to do these things.
monad is a construct that allows you to write imperative-style programs, to maintain state, and to do IO.

A type system is a syntactic method for enforcing levels of abstraction in programs.

Hindley-Milner (or “Damas-Milner”) is an algorithm for inferring value types based on use.
It literally formalizes the intuition that a type can be deduced by the functionality it supports.

type safety: does not allow the programmer to treat a value as a type to which it does not belong.
weak typing: use a value of one type as if it were a value of another type. example: C

techniques for solving problems:
Brute Force:
example: insertion sort
Divide and Conquer:
example: Mergesort and Quicksort
Greedy Programming:
Algorithms like Kruskal's and Prim's to find the minimum spanning tree of a graph and Dijkstra's to find the shortest path in a graph are classic examples of the greedy programming technique.
Dynamic Programming:
Problems like finding the longest common subsequence between two strings demonstrate one of the hallmarks of dynamic programming: overlapping subproblems that must be solved over and over again.

Dynamic programming:
Used for optimization problem.
solve problem by combining solutions to sub-problems.
sub-problems are not independent.
solve sub-problem in a bottom-up fashion.
store solution to a sub-problem
look up the solution when sub-problem is encountered again.
in order to use DP, the problem must have two attributes:
1. principle of optimality (optimal sub-structure):
in an optimal sequence of decisions, each sub-sequence must be optimal.
an optimal solution to the problem contains within it optimal solutions to sub-problems.
--> (best) the optimal solution to a problem consists of optimal solutions to sub-problems.
2. overlapping sub-problems:
there exist some places where we solve the same sub-problems more than once.
----
vs divide-and-conquer: cannot reuse solutions to sub-problems. non-overlapping sub-problems.
---
divide-and-conquer: break the problem into subproblems that are similar to the original
problem, solve the subproblems recursively, combine solutions to the subproblems to solve the original problem.
---
====
vs greedy algorithm:
greedy: make a local optimization. we just pick one solution.a special case of DP
--> make the choice that looks best at the moment. locally optimal choice.
top-down
-> follows local optimization.It tries to choose the solution which is locally optimum at that particular point of time and may not be the globally optimum solution.
DP: make a global optimization. pick the best solution from a collection of solutions
bottom-up
globally optimal choice

hysteresis: the dependence of the output of a system not only on its current input, but also on its
history of past inputs. The dependence arises because the history affects the value of an internal state.
--> memory of previous events

Operations transform resource or data inputs into desired goods, services, or results, and create and deliver value to the customers.

diff between remainder and modulo
remainder:
1 % 6 = 1
-1 % 6 = -1
1 % -6 = 1
-1 % -6 = -1
modulo:
1 \\ 6 = 1
-1 \\ 6 = 5
1 \\ -6 = -5
-1 \\ -6 = -1
Conclusion:
if dividend and divisor have same sign, same answer
remainder: answer has same sign as dividend

detention: late fee for overdue containers
demurrage: fee for returning laden container too early or picking up laden container too late.

type: a label used by the type system to prove some property of a program's behavior.
a type system is a collection of rules that assign a property called a type to the various
construct, such as variables, expressions, functions or module.
Haskell:
type class is like Java interface?
a type is an instance of a type class?

JSONP: JSON with padding
JSON structure wrapped in a function
e.g. myfunc({"name": "cheok"});

In computer programming, a shim is a small library that transparently intercepts API calls and changes the arguments passed, handles the operation itself, or redirects the operation elsewhere.

A connection timeout occurs only upon starting the TCP connection. This usually happens if the remote machine does not answer. This means that the server has been shut down, you used the wrong IP/DNS name or the network connection to the server is down.
----
A socket timeout is dedicated to monitor the continuous incoming data flow. If the data flow is interrupted for the specified timeout the connection is regarded as stalled/broken.

CNAME stands for Canonical Name. CNAME records can be used to alias one name to another.

For example, if you have a server where you keep all of your documents online, it might normally be accessed through docs.example.com. You may also want to access it through documents.example.com. One way to make this possible is to add a CNAME record that points documents.example.com to docs.example.com. When someone visits documents.example.com they will see the exact same content as docs.example.com.

step into: the next statement displayed is the first statement of the called function
step over: the next statement displayed is the next statement of the current function
step out: execute the remaining lines of a function. the next statement displayed is the statement following the function call.

A TCP socket is an endpoint instance defined by an IP address and a port in the context of either a particular TCP connection or the listening state.
A port is a virtualisation identifier defining a service endpoint (as distinct from a service instance endpoint aka session identifier).
  like a virtualised endpoint.
A TCP socket is not a connection, it is the endpoint of a specific connection.
There can be concurrent connections to a service endpoint, because a connection is identified by both its local and remote endpoints, allowing traffic to be routed to a specific service instance.
There can only be one listener socket for a given address/port combination.
The combination of an IP address and a port is strictly known as an endpoint and is sometimes called a socket. protocol too?
A TCP connection is defined by two endpoints aka sockets.
In order to get a service you need a service number. This service number is called a port.

ARP request : Computer ‘A’ asks on the network, “who has this IP?”
ARP reply : All the other computers ignore the request except the computer which has the requested IP. This computer, lets say ‘B’ says, I have the requested
    IP address and here is my MAC address.
RARP request: This is more or less same as ARP request, the difference being that in this message a MAC address is broad-casted on network.
RARP reply : Same concept. Computer ‘B’ tells that the requested MAC is mine and here is my IP address.

HTTP keep-alive, or HTTP connection reuse, is the idea of using a single TCP connection to send and receive multiple HTTP requests/responses,
as opposed to opening a new connection for every single request/response pair. The newer HTTP/2 protocol uses the same idea and takes it
further to allow multiple concurrent requests/responses to be multiplexed over a single connection.

template engine: generate HTML from a template file and application data.

Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR): allocate IP address space on any address bit boundary
