(the bane of my life)

cynosure: An object that serves as a focal point of attention and admiration.
Something that serves to guide.

spectral line: atoms absorb and give out light at characteristic wavelengths.
if they swallow more than they emit, the result is a dark line in the spectrum
of a celestial object. if they emit more than they swallow, the result is
a bright line.
Individual elements have their own spectrum. When hydrogen gas is heated,
it gives off only a few narrow colored lines that make up the unique spectral
fingerprint of that element. This is called emission spectrum. If light from
a star passes through a cool cloud of the same gas, the element will absorb
from the light the same colored bands produced by an emission spectrum, leaving
black lines in their place. The result is an absorption spectrum.
absorpton lines are produced when particular wavelenghts of radiation from a
hot source are absorbed by a cooler, intervening medium.

Because the moon completes each rotation in exactly the same time it takes
to revolve the Earth, we can only look at one side of the moon.
+++
the Moon is in a synchronous orbit (meaning it spins exactly once on its axis for
 every one revolution around Earth), forced to show the same face toward Earth for all eternity.

supernova: a cataclysmic explosion of a massive star. an explosion where
a dying star blows off its outer layers.

Right ascension: celestial equivalent of terrestrial longitude.

black body: a body that absorbs all the heat that falls on it.

In computer networking literature, digital bandwidth refers to data rate
measured in bit/s, for example channel capacity (digital bandwidth capacity)
or throughput (digital bandwidth consumption). The reason for this usage
is that the channel capacity in bit/s is proportional to the analogue bandwidth
in hertz according to Hartley's law.

In communication networks, throughput is the amount of digital data per
time unit that is delivered over a physical or logical link, or that is
passing through a certain network node. For example, it may be the amount
 of data that is delivered to a certain network terminal or host computer,
 or between two specific computers. The throughput is usually measured
in bits per second (bits/s or bps), occasionally in data packets per
 second or data packets per timeslot. The term corresponds to digital bandwidth consumption.

Cable modems are primarily used to deliver broadband Internet access,
taking advantage of unused bandwidth on a cable television network.
Like all residential broadband network technologies (e.g. DSL, FTTX,
 Satellite internet, WiMAX), a fixed channel capacity is shared by a
 population of users (in the case of cable internet, users in a neighborhood
share the available capacity provided by a single coaxial cable line).
 Therefore, service speed can vary depending on how many people are using the service at the same time.

octothorpe: the # sign

point-and-shoot vs SLR:
The image that the photographer sees through the viewfinder of a point-and-shoot
camera is not the same image that passes through the primary lens of the camera
 (that is, the lens that projects the image onto the film or,
in the case of digital cameras, the image sensor). Rather, the
image seen in the viewfinder of a point-and-shoot camera passes
 through a separate lens. SLRs, on the other hand, have only one lens,
and a mirror diverts the image from the lens into the viewfinder;
 that mirror then retracts when the picture is taken so that
 the image can be recorded on the film or sensor. It is because
of this method of diverting the image into the viewfinder that
 pictures cannot be previewed on the LCD screens of most digital SLRs.

fluorescence: Fluorescence is a luminescence that is mostly found as an
optical phenomenon in cold bodies, in which the molecular absorption of
a photon triggers the emission of another photon with a longer wavelength.
The energy difference between the absorbed and emitted photons ends up as
 molecular vibrations or heat. Usually the absorbed photon is in the
 ultraviolet range, and the emitted light is in the visible range,

The life of a CFL lamp is significantly shorter if it is only turned on for
 a few minutes at a time: In the case of a 5-minute on/off cycle the lifespan
of a CFL can be up to 85% shorter, reducing its lifespan to the level of an incandescent lamp
they burn out more quickly when cycled frequently.

In telecommunications, modulation is the process of varying a periodic
waveform, i.e. a tone, in order to use that signal to convey a message,

analog signal: a continuous-time signal.

Zoning is a term used in urban planning for a system of land-use regulation in various parts of the world.
The word is derived from the practice of designating permitted uses of land based on mapped
zones which separate one set of land uses from another.
Theoretically, the primary purpose of zoning is to segregate uses that are thought
 to be incompatible; in practice, zoning is used as a permitting system to prevent
new development from harming existing residents or businesses.
A term that refers to a system of land-use  regulation that specifies
what can be built on a piece of land.

dentistry:
 The letter part of the code refers to different parts or surfaces of the tooth.
An "M" mesial, or "D" distal, is the front or back surface of the tooth, respectively.
An "O" occlusal, is the top or biting surface of a back tooth (molar or premolar),
and "I" incisal, is the biting edge of front teeth (incisors and canines).
 A "B" buccal, is the surface of the tooth towards the cheek, and an "L" lingual,
 is the surface of the tooth towards the tongue. So if the dentist says number
3MOD, you'll know that you have a cavity on your upper right first molar,
 involving the front, top, and back parts of the tooth.
occlusal: biting surface
mesial: toward the center of the mouth, Situated toward the middle of the front of the jaw along the curve of the dental arch.
distal: away from the center of the mouth, Situated farthest from the middle and front of the jaw, as a tooth or tooth surface.
facial: toward the face
buccal: toward the cheek
lingual: toward the tongue

sealant: resins that are applied in the pits and fissures of the chewing surfaces of teeth
to protect those surfaces. First etch the surface with acid to create a porous
surface to which the resin will adhere.
bonding: used in the restoration of discolored, damaged, or missing teeth.

A cusp is an occlusal or incisal eminence on a tooth.

silver amalgam: biocompatible (unlikely to iritate living tissue. not actually
cemented to the cavity walls. it is held in place by a close frictional
fit, plus undercutting the cavity  to lock in the in the filling when it hardens.
require at least 24 hours before reaching full strength (do not chew on it for
at least 24 hours). require support from the surrounding tooth to keep it from
chipping or shattering.

composite resin: not as strong as amalgam. not biocompatible, must be separated
from living tissue with bases or liners. easily stained. boundaries between
the tooth and the filling tend to open up.

Dental sealants (also known as "tooth sealants") can play an important role
in helping to prevent tooth decay ("cavities") in some locations on teeth.
 The placement of dental sealants involves your dentist bonding a plastic
 coating into the grooves of your tooth (the tooth's pits and fissures).
 The net result is a smoother tooth surface, one which is less likely to
trap food and plaque and one which is easier to clean with your toothbrush.

PPO: offer a list of dentists/doctors who have agreed to provide services
at a discounted fee.

HMO: dentist/doctor agrees to provide care in exchange for an amount prepaid
by the insurer per consumer per month. (capitation fee)

Blue Cross and Blue Shield consists of a network of local community health service corporations.
A nationwide federation, Blue Cross and Blue Shield operate under and
are covered by state laws as not-for-profit service providers.
Blue Cross covers hospital costs, as well as outpatient care and home care.
Blue Shield plans cover physicians' services, dental, vision, and some
outpatient services. The two plans cooperate with one another
 to provide a form of comprehensive coverage for the subscribers to the plans.

Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) provides prepaid comprehensive health care
 services to an enrolled group of members within a specified area -- controlled
by geography and enrollment allowances. Its doctors are employed by the HMO, on
a salary which is not dictated by the number or patients or the nature of the
 treatment given. The HMO selects its doctors, hospitals and other care facilities,
 which are solely offered under its coverage. An HMO may be contracted by both
for-profit and nonprofit health organizations to provide care.
The enrollee is required to choose a primary care provider, and agree to only see them for medical care.
There is no deductible or coinsurance for health care, and little red tape if you go in for care services.
A benefit of HMOs is the coverage for preventative health care, including
checkups and many testing procedures. In fact, emphasis is placed on preventative medicine
Most HMO coverage is employer-provided, and is group coverage. That
is, a group of people are enrolled at a group rate,
Freedom of choice exists only within the infrastructure of selected doctors
and facilities. To be fully covered by the HMO, the insured has to use
the HMO's previously arranged services.

Staff Model HMOs: is a network of salaried employees of the HMO,
consisting of doctors, physicians and specialists who are employed
s by the HMO, and the facility is often owned by the HMO.
However, most have contracts with other hospitals and physicians to provide
 care to HMO clients at other facilities. Internal medicine physicians,
 family physicians, and pediatricians are chosen from the hospital-based HMO staff

Group Model HMO: A physicians group is contracted by the HMO to provide
its specific services to the enrollees. Rarely are the physicians directly
employed, nor are the HMO participants their only patients.

Independent Practice Associations (IPAs): Individual private practitioners are contracted,
and they are paid a fixed fee per each patient they agree to treat under HMO contract.
They are chosen by the HMO members as the primary care doctors. IPAs offer more choice
 to HMO recipients, since there are a lot of private practice doctors to choose from,
once the HMO contract has been prepared with the physicians. It is also sometimes
 possible to avoid changing your doctor when you change to an IPA-HMO, if a
contract can be established between the HMO and your current doctor(s).

Point Of Service Plans (POS):
 Traditionally, HMOs have kept their costs to a minimum by managing care. To manage
care, HMOs keep medical care and expenses in their network of doctors and facilities.
HMOs commonly frown on its members seeking care outside the network, and maintain
this system by requiring members to pay high out-of-pocket (sometimes footing the
entire bill) costs when care is provided by physicians who are not employed or contracted by the HMO.
The POS was developed to provide HMO members with more choices. Still restricted
 somewhat (not offered by all HMOs or employers., POs plans offer coverage outside
the network of the HMO, but the coverage outside the network resembles traditional
 health care insurance, where it is required to pay a deductible for that care
outside the HMO structure. This coverage is most often chosen by a family that
wishes to see a family physician they have dealt with for years, but who is not
 a part of their HMO system.

Preferred Provider Organization (PPO): A PPO is usually put together by an
insurance company or employer, in that they arrange a network of doctors and
 hospitals to provide care at a lower cost than traditional insurance.
PPOs have higher premiums, and also require the payment of a deductible for health services.
 The system works as though one were simply getting a percentage discount on
medical care. In this manner, it is a fee-for-service policy, rather than
prepaid for services. For coverage outside the network, the insurer pays
less of the bill and the insured has more out-of-pocket expenses. In some
ways the PPO is a lot more lenient. For example, it is not necessary to
choose a primary care physician and only receive care from that provider.

medicare:
   1.   Those 65 or older who are also eligible for Social Security benefits based on their acquired credits and years in the work force.
   2. Those disabled and under the age of 65 -- but they have to meet requirements of Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) through the Disability Determination Service (DDS. of the particular state government.
   3. People any age who have permanent kidney failure.
   4. Those 65 or older who are beneficiaries of Railroad Retirement.
Medicare:
Part A covers costs while hospitalized, and services procured in the
hospital. Inpatient services which are deemed medically necessary are
 covered, as well as hospice care for the terminally ill. Home health
care is fully covered, as well as 80 percent of necessary medical
equipment. If the patient must pay for blood on a regular basis,
Medicare Part A will pick up the payments after the insured pays
for the first three pints (three pints a year). The premium of
part A coverage is covered by FICA taxes as long as one is approved for Social Security.
Part B coverage helps pay for physician services, other medical procedures, and supplies including tests, prescription drugs, speech therapy and other services. Medicare Part B requires that the recipient pay a premium for this coverage.

Medicare Supplement Policies (Medigap):
are not government policies as are Medicare and Medicaid, although Medigap
 may be regulated strictly by some states. In most states, Medigap is offered
 to Medicare recipients over the age of 65, and the coverage picks up where Medicare lacks in coverage
coverage is offered by private insurers,

Medicaid: Run by the states, unlike the federally funded Medicare program,
Medicaid provides health coverage for low-income families and individuals who have few assets.

Insurance can be defined as a means to reduce risk or the uncertainty of loss by
bringing together enough entities exposed to loss to make their individual
losses collectively predictable, often referred to as the "Law of Large Numbers"

strategic  refers to the "what and why" and tactical refers to the "how."

Strategic thinking, planning, and actions reflect the doer's ability to consider
 the big picture, recognize patterns and trends, honor priorities, anticipate
issues, predict outcomes, and have smart alternatives to fall back upon. Strategic
issues deal with overriding mission and purpose, why the organization exists,
how it makes a difference that others don't or can't make, and where it will be in the future.

Tactical refers to the hands-on part of getting the job done, making sure the
strategic goals are met. It's performing each implementation task with quality and efficiency.

The Prudent Man Rule is based on common law stemming from the 1830 Massachusetts
 court decision - Harvard College v. Armory, 9 Pick. (26 Mass.) 446, 461 (1830).
The Prudent Man Rule directs trustees "to observe how men of prudence, discretion
 and intelligence manage their own affairs, not in regard to speculation, but in
regard to the permanent disposition of their funds, considering the probable
income, as well as the probable safety of the capital to be invested"
The fiduciary is required to invest trust assets as a "prudent man" would invest
his own property with the following factors in mind: the needs of beneficiaries,
 the need to preserve the estate (or corpus of the trust) and the amount and
regularity of income. The application of these general principles depends on
the type of account administered. The Prudent Man Rule continues to be the
sprevailing statute in a small number of states.

An application server is a software engine that delivers applications to client computers
 or devices, typically through the Internet and using the HyperText Transfer Protocol.
 Application servers are distinguished from web servers by the extensive use of
server-side dynamic content and frequent integration with database engines.

An application server handles most, if not all, of the business logic and data
access of the application (see Centralization). The main benefit of an application
server is the ease of application development, since applications need not be programmed;
 instead, they are assembled from building blocks provided by the application server.

--> A straw man argument attempts to refute a given proposition by showing that a slightly different or inaccurate form of the proposition (the "straw man") is absurd or ridiculous
--> A straw man argument is an informal fallacy based on misrepresentation of an opponent's position.
To "attack a straw man" is to create the illusion of having refuted a proposition by
substituting a superficially similar proposition (the "straw man"), and refuting it,
 without ever having actually refuted the original position
+++
a stand-in created to draw attention away from the central issue
===
The Straw Man fallacy is committed when a person simply ignores a person's actual position
and substitutes a distorted, exaggerated or misrepresented version of that position.
This sort of "reasoning" has the following pattern:

   1. Person A has position X.
   2. Person B presents position Y (which is a distorted version of X).
   3. Person B attacks position Y.
   4. Therefore X is false/incorrect/flawed.

Examples of Straw Man

   1. Prof. Jones: "The university just cut our yearly budget by $10,000."
      Prof. Smith: "What are we going to do?"
      Prof. Brown: "I think we should eliminate one of the teaching assistant positions.
		That would take care of it."
      Prof. Jones: "We could reduce our scheduled raises instead."
      Prof. Brown: " I can't understand why you want to bleed us dry like that, Jones."

   2. "Senator Jones says that we should not fund the attack submarine program. I disagree entirely.
	I can't understand why he wants to leave us defenseless like that."

   3. Bill and Jill are arguing about cleaning out their closets:
      Jill: "We should clean out the closets. They are getting a bit messy."
      Bill: "Why, we just went through those closets last year. Do we have to clean them out everyday?"
      Jill: "I never said anything about cleaning them out every day. You just want to keep all your
	junk forever, which is just ridiculous."

relay
A relay is a device that allows a small amount of electrical current to control a large amount of current.

Cluster vs. Grid
++
A cluster is a group of computers organized together to perform the same set of functions.
For instance, you may have a cluster running your database software.
++
A grid is a collection of resources. A grid can be composed of multiple clusters.
In Oracle's grid world, you can have a cluster of servers running the database software and a cluster of servers running the Application Server software. Since they are all in the grid, you can move resources from one cluster to another should demands dictate.
+++
In sum, a cluster is one large computer made up of small, similar computers, just
 as R.A.I.D. is one large hard disk made up of small hard disks. Whereas a grid is a bunch of computers that make their unused resources available to select computers (often a single server) over a network.
++
In cluster computing, a bunch of similar (or identical) computers are hooked up locally
(in the same physical location, directly connected with very high speed connections) to operate as
a single computer. The computers that make up the cluster cannot be operated independently
as separate computers. A cluster, as far as any software or other computer is concerned, looks
like essentially one big computer.
++
in grid computing, the computers do not have to be in the same physical location and can be operated
independently. As far as other computers are concerned each computer on the grid is a distinct computer.
Computers on a network have a program on them that allows unused resources (usually processing time and memory)
 to be used by another computer on the network.

middleware: is computer software that connects software components or applications.

An application server, in an n-tier architecture, is a server that hosts an API to expose
business logic and business processes for use by third-party applications.

Business rule is a statement that defines or constrains some aspect of the business. It is
intended to assert business structure or to control or influence the behavior of the business.

business logic:
models real life business objects (such as accounts, loans, itineraries, and inventories)
Business logic comprises:

* business rules that express business policy (such as channels, location, logistics, prices, and products); and
* workflows that are the ordered tasks of passing documents or data from one participant
  (a person or a software system) to anothother

come down on the side of

availability: the percentage of time that a system operates during its intended duty cycle.
High availability: specifies an amount of time as a percentage of the intended duty
cycle that a system must be functional.
+++
High availability vs. fault tolerance
The difference between fault tolerance and high availability, is this: A fault tolerant
 environment has no service interruption but a significantly higher cost, while a highly
 available environment has a minimal service interruption.
+++
Fault tolerance relies on specialized hardware to detect a hardware fault and instantaneously
switch to a redundant hardware component whether the failed component is a processor, memory board,
 power supply, I/O subsystem, or storage subsystem. Although this cutover is apparently
seamless and offers non-stop service, a high premium is paid in both hardware cost and
performance because the redundant components do no processing. More importantly, the fault
tolerant model does not address software failures, by far the most common reason for downtime.
++++++
High availability views availability not as a series of replicated physical components, but
rather as a set of system-wide, shared resources that cooperate to guarantee essential
services. High availability combines software with industry-standard hardware to minimize
 downtime by quickly restoring essential services when a system, component, or application
fails. While not instantaneous, services are restored rapidly, often in less than a minute.

In all fairness,

astringent
is a chemical that tends to shrink or constrict body tissues, usually locally after topical
medicinal application.
++++
Astringency is also the dry, puckering mouthfeel caused by tannins found in many fruits such as
blackthorn, chokecherry, bird cherry and persimmon fruits, and banana skins. The tannins denature
 the salivary proteins, causing a rough "sandpapery" sensation in the mouth.
+++
Astringent substances are also found in some red wines and teas.
+++
Astringent medicines cause shrinkage of mucous membranes or exposed tissues and are often used
internally to check discharge of blood serum or mucous secretions. This can happen with a sore
throat, hemorrhages, diarrhea, or with peptic ulcers. Externally applied astringents, which
cause mild coagulation of skin proteins, dry, harden, and protect the skin.

Impromptu speaking

Impromptu Response Structures

* The first one is called PREP: Position, reason, example, position (PREP). In this model,
first you state your position on the topic, and then you state your reason for taking that position.
 Next, you provide an example or story that supports your reason. Finally, you summarize by restating
your position.
* The second structure is called PEP: Point, Example, Point (PEP). It's easier than the first one
and can be used to answer a wider variety of questions. In this one you start by briefly making
a point or stating a key idea or objective. Then you give an example or story that proves your point.
Then you wrap up by restating the main idea, or your main point. When you are short on time, this is
the way to go.
*** PEP: Point, evidence, point:
Obesity is a serious problem in the United States (Point).
Obesity is associated with over 100,000 deaths per year (Evidence).
The National Institutes of Health reported that about two-thirds of U.S. adults are obese (Point).
**** PEP: point, example, point:

* The final structure calls for you to quickly think of a way to divide up your response. I call
 this one divide and conquer. There are a few classic two and three part divisions that you'll want
to memorize such as: past, present, future; problem, solution; cost, benefit; us, them;
ideal, real; low, medium, high. Of course, there are many of these, so try to practice the
 ones that are common to your field. These are easy, you just pick an appropriate division
and then include a little bit for each section.

hashing
Hashing is the transformation of a string of characters into a usually shorter fixed-length value
or key that represents the original string. Hashing is used to index and retrieve items in a
 database because it is faster to find the item using the shorter hashed key than to find it
 using the original value. It is also used in many encryption algorithms.
+++
A hash function is any well-defined procedure or mathematical function which converts a large,
possibly variable-sized amount of data into a small datum, usually a single integer that may
serve as an index into an array. The values returned by a hash function are called hash values,
hash codes, hash sums, or simply hashes.

transitive closure:
in computer science the concept of transitive closure can be thought of as constructing
a data structure that makes it possible to answer reachability questions [1]. That is,
can one get from node a to node d in one or more hops? A binary relation tells you only
 that node a is connected to node b, and that node b is connected to node c, etc. After
the transitive closure is constructed, as depicted in the following figure, in an O(1)
operation one may determine that node d is reachable from node a. The data structure is
typically stored as a matrix, so if matrix[1][4] = 1, then it is the case that node 1
can reach node 4 through one or more hops.
+++
Transitive closure can be thought of as establishing a data structure that makes
it possible to solve reachability questions (can I get to x from y?) efficiently.
After the preprocessing of constructing the transitive closure, all reachability
queries can be answered in constant time by simply reporting a matrix entry. Transitive
closure is fundamental in propagating the consequences of modified attributes of a graph G.
 For example, consider the graph underlying any spreadsheet model, where the vertices are
cells and there is an edge from cell $i$ to cell j if the result of cell j depends on
cell i. When the value of a given cell is modified, the values of all reachable cells
must also be updated. The identity of these cells is revealed by the transitive closure
of G. Many database problems reduce to computing transitive closures, for analogous reasons.
+++
related to directed graph
+++
Several graph-based algorithms have been proposed in the literature to compute
the transitive closure of a directed graph
+++
transitive closure is a data structure for answering reachability questions:
can I get from point A to point B? usually in the form of a matrix,
e.g., matrix[1][4]=1 means I can go from point 1 to point 4.

+++
charset
the combination of a coded character set and a character-encoding scheme
======
Code points are the numbers that can be used in a coded character set. A coded character set defines
a range of valid code points, but doesn't necessarily assign characters to all those code points.
=====
Supplementary characters are characters with code points in the range U+10000 to U+10FFFF, that is,
those characters that could not be represented in the original 16-bit design of Unicode. The set of
characters from U+0000 to U+FFFF is sometimes referred to as the Basic Multilingual Plane
(BMP). Thus, each Unicode character is either in the BMP or a supplementary character.
===
A character encoding scheme is a mapping from the numbers of one or more coded character sets to
sequences of one or more fixed-width code units. The most commonly used code units are bytes, but
16-bit or 32-bit integers can also be used for internal processing. UTF-32, UTF-16, and UTF-8 are
character encoding schemes for the coded character set of the Unicode standard.
======
Unicode plane: is a continuous group of 65,536 (2^16) code points.
code point: a numerical value (integer) that makes up the code space.
=====
Unicode equivalence: some sequences of code points represent the same characters.
example: (canonical equivalence): same appearance and meaning when displayed
an e-acute can be represented as a single rune (U+00e9) or
an e followed by an acute accent U+0301
-----
compatibility equivalence: characters that represent the same thing but have a different
visual appearance. example: superscript digit 9 vs the regular digit 9
======
from java:
A character is a minimal unit of text that has semantic value.
===
A character set is a collection of characters that might be used by multiple languages. For example,
the Latin character set is used by English and most European languages
===
A coded character set is a character set where each character is assigned a unique number.
===
A code point is a numerical value that can be used in a coded character set. A code point is a 32-bit int data
type, where the lower 21 bits represent a valid code point value and the upper 11 bits are 0.
===
A Unicode code unit is a 16-bit char value
===
The valid code point range for the Unicode standard is U+0000 to U+10FFFF, inclusive.
====
the range U+10000 to U+10FFFF are called supplementary characters. The set of characters from
U+0000 to U+FFFF are sometimes referred to as the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP).
=====
A grapheme is a sequence of one or more code points that are displayed as a single, graphical unit
that a reader recognizes as a single element of the writing system.
===
A glyph is an image, usually stored in a font (which is a collection of glyphs), used to represent
graphemes or parts thereof.
=====
A Unicode code unit is a bit size used by a particular Unicode encoding.
For example UTF-8 has a code unit size of 8 bits and UTF-16 has 16
and UTF-32 has 32.
=====
code point: an integer assigned to a character
=====
Java uses UTF-16 and this means the code unit size is 16 bits.
So to represent code points outside the BMP the UTF-16 encoding specifies surrogate pairs. For this
two special ranges are defined within the BMP.  In UTF-16 any character outside the BMP is
represented by two 16 bit code units in this range.  (In fact surrogate characters are defined only
for UTF-16).
======
So counting 16 bit code units will not yield the correct "length of characters".
String.length() returns the number of code units in the String.
Since 1.5 you can use codePointCount(int beginIndex, int endIndex) to get the length of the
characters.  It will count a surrogate pair as one character.

difference
SAN: uses Fibre Channel interconnects (wire), encapsulated SCSI (protocol)
NAS: uses Ethernet and TCP/IP

Java generics
allow "a type or method to operate on objects of various types while providing compile-time type safety
++++
allows the programmer to specify the type that will be accepted by an object.
classic example: collection framework
by default, a collection can accept any object.
generics allows the programmer to create a collection that accepts only
a certain of objects. This allows the compiler to check the type correctness
of the program at compile-time.
+++
allow programmer to specify concrete types to general purpose classes and methods
that operated on Object.
allow you to limit what kind of objects can be inserted into the collection.
+++
Generic programming is a style of computer programming in which algorithms are written
in terms of to-be-specified-later types that are then instantiated when needed for specific
types provided as parameters.
====
allow you to write code that operates on objects whose types have not been determined.
=====
generics: allow you to write code that operates on unspecified types.
=====
generic type: a generic class/interface that is parameterized over types. allow you
to write a generic class/interface that works with different types.
===
called generics in Java and C#, template in C++, parameterized type by gang of four.
+++
type erasure:
When a generic type is instantiated, the compiler translates those types by a technique called
type erasure  a process where the compiler removes all information related to type parameters
 and type arguments within a class or method. Type erasure enables Java applications that use
generics to maintain binary compatibility with Java libraries and applications that were
 created before generics.
e.g. ArrayList<String> is translated to ArrayList, which is called the raw type.
raw type: a generic class without any type arguments.
++++
A class is generic if it declares one or more type variables. These type variables are known
as the type parameters of the class.

canonical:
Authoritative or standard; conforming to an accepted rule or procedure.
When referring to programming, canonical means conforming to well-established patterns or rules.
When referring to IP addressing, canonical means the authoritative host name stored

bookmarklet
A bookmarklet is an applet, a small computer application, stored as the URL of a bookmark
 in a web browser or as a hyperlink on a web page. The term is a portmanteau of
the terms bookmark and applet. Whether bookmarklet utilities are stored as bookmarks
or hyperlinks, they are designed to add one-click functionality to a browser or web
 page. When clicked, a bookmarklet performs some function, one of a wide variety
such as a search query or data extraction. Usually the applet is a JavaScript program.

Objects In Mirror Are Closer Than They Appear
passenger-side side-view mirror
passenger-side mirrors are convex to allow the drivers to get a wide-angle view of the road
-- behind them and to the sides -- but at the same time, causes objects to appear more distant.
A flat mirror used on driver's side mirrors, on the other hand, would not provide a wider view
of the road.

ODBC
a standard that enables applications to interact with different db. a wrapper around
databases that makes all db behave in a consistent and clearly defined fashion.
It accomplishes this by using s/w drivers that two primary functions. First, they
encapsulate any native db features and hide these from the client. Second, they provide
a common language for interacting with the db.
ODBC client applications do not interact with db directly. Instead, they interact with
ODBC data sources. a data source is logical db that includes the driver (each db type
has its own driver) and info on how to connect to the db.

copy-on-write
an optimizing strategy in computer programming. here's how it works.
let's say multiple processes want to access a resource. instead of giving
each process a copy of the resource, you give them a pointer to the same resource.
when one of the processes tries to modify the resource, you create a private copy
for that process. this prevents the changes from becoming visible to everyone else.

shadow paging
a copy-on-write technique for avoiding in-place updates of pages. when a page is to
be modified, a shadow page is allocated. The shadow page is then modified (the
original page is unchanged). when the shadow page is ready to become persistent,
all pages that refer to the original are updated to refer to the new replacement page.

========= cloud computing ==========
cloud computing
The cloud is a metaphor for "the Internet."
cloud computing means using the Internet to provide your programs and store your data.
+++
a general term for anything that involves delivering hosted services over the Internet.
These services are broadly divided into three categories: Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS),
Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS).
+++
A cloud service has three distinct characteristics that differentiate it from traditional
hosting. It is sold on demand, typically by the minute or the hour; it is elastic -- a
user can have as much or as little of a service as they want at any given time; and
the service is fully managed by the provider (the consumer needs nothing but a personal
computer and Internet access).
+++
an elastic, pay per use computing architecture and model
+++
Infrastructure-as-a-Service like Amazon Web Services provides virtual server instances
with unique IP addresses and blocks of storage on demand. Customers use the provider's
application program interface (API) to start, stop, access and configure their virtual
servers and storage
+++
Platform-as-a-service in the cloud is defined as a set of software and product
 development tools hosted on the provider's infrastructure. Developers create
applications on the provider's platform over the Internet. PaaS providers may
use APIs, website portals or gateway software installed on the customer's computer.
 Force.com, (an outgrowth of Salesforce.com) and GoogleApps are examples of PaaS.
+++
In the software-as-a-service cloud model, the vendor supplies the hardware infrastructure,
 the software product and interacts with the user through a front-end portal. SaaS is
a very broad market. Services can be anything from Web-based email to inventory control
and database processing. Because the service provider hosts both the application and
the data, the end user is free to use the service from anywhere.
====
A public cloud is one in which a cloud service provider makes resources such as servers,
 storage, networking and, possibly, applications available to users over the Internet.
example: Amazon's EC2
++
Private clouds take two forms: internal clouds and external private clouds. An internal cloud
is inside your data center (on-premises), giving IT managers complete control over the available resources.
example: Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud and Microsoft Azure are examples of packaged software for creating internal clouds.
+++
External private clouds combine characteristics of internal clouds and public clouds. They are like
 public clouds because they are off-premises. But unlike public clouds, applications run on dedicated
 servers, and the cloud provider has built container walls around the external private cloud to make
it more secure than public clouds. example: Amazon's Virtual Private Cloud
=====
cloud computing (another definition)
Cloud computing is a category of computing solutions in which a technology and/or service lets
users access computing resources on demand, as needed, whether the resources are physical or
virtual, dedicated, or shared, and no matter how they are accessed (via a direct connection,
LAN, WAN, or the Internet). The cloud is often characterized by self-service interfaces that
let customers acquire resources when needed as long as needed.
+++
a computing solution that allows the users to access computing resources on demand
regardless of capacity or duration.
+++++
a way to increase capacity or add capabilities on the fly without investing in new infrastructure,
training new personnel, or licensing new software. Cloud computing encompasses any subscription-based
or pay-per-use service that, in real time over the Internet, extends IT's existing capabilities.
+++
SaaS
This type of cloud computing delivers a single application through the browser to thousands of
customers using a multitenant architecture. On the customer side, it means no upfront investment in
 servers or software licensing; on the provider side, with just one app to maintain, costs are
low compared to conventional hosting.
+++
utility computing
offer storage and virtual servers that IT can access on demand.
+++
Platform-as-a-service
delivers development environments as a service.
You build your own applications that run on the provider's infrastructure and are delivered to your users
via the Internet from the provider's servers.
--> provide a cloud-based application development environment. allow developers to build applications
that run in a cloud.

container: a run-time environment for components.

servlet: purpose is to receive HTTP requests, generate dynamic data (usually in HTML),
and delver an HTTP response.
Servlets are pure Java objects that generate HTML by writing it to a stream. The files
do not contain any HTML tags; they simply contain Java code which write out HTML (as strings)
 to produce the page that is sent to the user's browser.

JSP: an HTML page containing embedded java code. an HTML page embedded with java code.

JSPs and servlets are two different ways to accomplish the same goal: generating dynamic HTML pages
 using Java code. One puts Java code in your HTML, and one puts HTML in your Java code.
Functionally, they are equivalent. In fact, under the covers, the web server takes a JSP and
converts it to the corresponding servlet and dynamically compiles it.

JSPs live in an object called a container, which is essentially a server

Design by Contract (DbC) or Programming by Contract is an approach to designing computer
software. It prescribes that software designers should define formal, precise and verifiable
interface specifications for software components, which extend the ordinary definition
of abstract data types with preconditions, postconditions and invariants.
+++
preconditions: what must be true when the method is called
postconditions: what must be true after the method completes
class invariant: what must be true about each instance of a class
+++
design by contract says that there are 3 concepts about any piece of code:
preconditions, postconditions, and invariants
+++
precondition: expect a certain condition to be true on entry
postcondition: guarantee a certain condition on exit
invariant: maintain a certain condition
--- 3 questions about the contract:
what does the contract expect?
what does the contract guarantee?
what does the contract maintain?

virtual memory
An imaginary memory area supported by some operating systems
in conjunction with the hardware. You can think of virtual memory as an alternate set of
 memory addresses. Programs use these virtual addresses rather than real addresses to store
instructions and data. When the program is actually executed, the virtual addresses are
converted into real memory addresses.
The purpose of virtual memory is to enlarge the address space, the set of addresses a program
 can utilize. For example, virtual memory might contain twice as many addresses as main memory.
 A program using all of virtual memory, therefore, would not be able to fit in main memory all
 at once. Nevertheless, the computer could execute such a program by copying into main memory
those portions of the program needed at any given point during execution.
To facilitate copying virtual memory into real memory, the operating system divides virtual
 memory into pages, each of which contains a fixed number of addresses. Each page is stored
on a disk until it is needed. When the page is needed, the operating system copies it from
disk to main memory, translating the virtual addresses into real addresses.
+++
 gives an application program the impression that it has contiguous working memory
(an address space), while in fact it may be physically fragmented and may even
 overflow on to disk storage.

thrashing
In systems that use virtual memory, the resulting condition of a hard drive being used
 excessively for virtual memory because the physical memory (i.e., RAM) is full.
(The process of moving data into and out of virtual memory also is called swapping pages.)

ecliptic

solar day
the time it takes for the earth to complete one rotation with respect to the sun (24 hr)
the length of the solar day fluctuates throughout the year.
the average length is 24 hr: mean solar day

solar noon
the time when the sun is highest in the sky

sidereal day
the time it takes for the earth to complete one rotation with respect to the stars (23 hr 56 minutes)

====
equation of time
The difference in time between what your watch reads and the position of the sun
(clock time vs. sun time) is called the Equation-of-Time. If you are in the northern
 hemisphere and the sun's position is to the east of where your watch indicates it
would be, the Equation-of-Time is negative. If the sun is to the west, the Equation-of-Time is positive.

test fixture
A test fixture is something used to consistently test some item, device, or piece of software.
a test fixture is all the things that must be in place in order to run a test and expect a particular outcome.
frequently fixtures are created by handling setUp() and tearDown()  events of the unit testing framework. In setUp()  one would create the expected state for the test, and in tearDown()  it would clean up what had been set up.

Four phases of a test:
   1. Set up -- Setting up the test fixture.
   2. Exercise -- Interact with the system under test.
   3. Verify -- Determine whether the expected outcome has been obtained.
   4. Tear down -- Tear down the test fixture to return to the original state.

test fixture is a fixed state of a set of objects used as a baseline for running tests. The
purpose of a test fixture is to ensure that there is a well known and fixed environment in which
tests are run so that results are repeatable. Examples of fixtures:

Preparation of input data and setup/creation of fake or mock objects
Loading a database with a specific, known set of data
Copying a specific known set of files creating a test fixture will create a set of objects initialized to certain states.

test fixture: represents the preparation need to perform a test, and any cleanup actions.

what gets tracked, gets improved

Class of service (CoS):
is a way of managing traffic in a network by grouping similar types of traffic
(for example, e-mail, streaming video, voice, large document file transfer) together
 and treating each type as a class with its own level of service priority. Unlike Quality
of Service (QoS) traffic management, Class of Service technologies do not guarantee a level
 of service in terms of bandwidth and delivery time; they offer a "best-effort." On the other
hand, CoS technology is simpler to manage and more scalable as a network grows in structure
 and traffic volume. One can think of CoS as "coarsely-grained" traffic control and QoS as
 "finely-grained" traffic control.
+++++++++++
a form of priority queuing that has been used in a number of communication and networking protocols.
It is a way of classifying and prioritizing packets based on application type
++++
CoS is a queuing discipline while QoS covers a wider range of techniques to manage bandwidth and network resources.
+++
As an analogy, CoS is like classifying packages for delivery via regular mail, second-day delivery,
or next-day delivery. QoS is what the delivery company does to ensure your packages are delivered
on time (such as package tracking, air transport, door-to-door pickup and drop-off).

coupling: the degree to which a module depends on another module.
cohesion: the degree to which elements of a module belong together.
cohesion: a measure of how strongly-related or focused the responsibilities of a single module are
--> cohesion: the degree to which a component's responsibilities form a meaningful unit;
--> Cohesion refers to the relatedness of the data and methods within a class.
Good cohesion is desired within object-oriented programming so that each class has a well defined purpose and therefore contains the variables and methods necessary to fulfill that purpose.
low coupling often correlates with high cohesion

each: execute a block of code for each element of a list
map: apply a function to each element of a list and return a new list of the same size.
reduce/fold: combine all the elements of a list using a function and return a single value.

MapReduce
from lisp:
map:
let's say we have a square function: square(x) = x*x

calling map square [1,2,3,4,5] will return [1,4,9,16,25], as map will go through the
 list, and apply the function square to each element.

reduce/fold:
folding of the list [1,2,3,4,5] with the addition operator would result in 15, the
 sum of the elements of the list [1,2,3,4,5]

In Lisp, a map takes as input a function and a sequence of values. It then applies
 the function to each value in the sequence. A reduce combines all the elements of a
sequence using a binary operation. For example, it can use "+" to add up all the elements in the sequence.

mapreduce of google:

map: takes an input pair and produces a set of intermediate key/value pairs.
reduce: accepts an intermediate key and a set of values for that key. It merges together these
 values to form a possibly smaller set of values.
---
All values with the same key are presented to a single reduce task.

e.g.
consider the problem of counting the number of occurrences of each word in a large collection of documents:

map(String key, String value):
// key: document name
// value: document contents
for each word w in value:
  EmitIntermediate(w, "1");

reduce(String key, Iterator values):
// key: a word
// values: a list of counts
int result = 0;
for each v in values:
  result += ParseInt(v);
Emit(AsString(result));

--more:
there is a intermediate (shuffle) step between map and reduce where the output of map is grouped by key;
--example:
map emits: {'hello': {count:1}}, {'world': {count: 1}}, {'hello': {count: 1}}
shuffle produces:
{'hello': [{count: 1},{count: 1}]) , {'world': [{count:1}])
the output of shuffle goes to reduce
--
Map(k1,v1) → list(k2,v2)
intermediate: list(k2,v2) -> list(k2, list(v2))
Reduce(k2, list (v2)) → list(v3)

The map function emits each word plus an associated count of occurrences ("1" in this example).
 The reduce function sums together all the counts emitted for a particular word.
Here, each document is split in words, and each word is counted initially with a "1" value by the Map
 function, using the word as the result key. The framework puts together all the pairs with the same
 key and feeds them to the same call to Reduce, thus this function just needs to sum all of its
 input values to find the total appearances of that word.

JVM heap: an area of memory used for dynamic memory allocation. divided into 3 generations:
    * The young generation stores short-lived objects that are created and immediately garbage collected.
    * Objects that persist longer are moved to the old generation (also called the tenured generation).
    * The permanent generation (or permgen) is used for class definitions and associated metadata.

materialized view
the query result is cached  as a concrete table that may be updated from the original base
 tables from time to time. This enables much more efficient access, at the cost of some data
being potentially out-of-date. It is most useful in data warehousing scenarios, where frequent
 queries of the actual base tables can be extremely expensive.
A materialized view is a database object that contains the results of a query. They are local
 copies of data located remotely, or are used to create summary tables based on aggregations
 of a table's data. Materialized views, which store data based on remote tables are also, know as snapshots.
the material view is manifested as a real table.
==> regular view:
a view is a virtual table representing the result of a database query. Whenever an ordinary view's
 table is queried or updated, the DBMS converts these into queries or updates against the underlying
 base tables
--
A materialized view takes a different approach: the query result is cached as a concrete
("materialized") table (rather than a view as such) that may be updated from the original base
tables from time to time. This enables much more efficient access, at the cost of extra storage and
of some data being potentially out-of-date.

 including Ajax Push, Reverse Ajax, Two-way-web, HTTP Streaming, and HTTP server push

Push technology, or server push, describes a style of Internet-based communication where the request
 for a given transaction is initiated by the publisher or central server.
It is contrasted with pull technology, where the request for the transmission of information is
 initiated by the receiver or client.

duck typing
the type of an object is defined by what it can do
This method of not caring about the actual type of a variable, just relying on what methods
 it supports is known as Duck Typing.

edge case
a problem or situation that occurs only at an extreme (maximum or minimum) operating parameter.

boundary case is frequently used in software engineering  to refer to the behavior of a system when
 one of its inputs is at or just beyond its maximum or minimum limits. It is frequently used when
discussing software testing.
For example, if an input field is meant to accept only integer values 0 - 100, entering the
 values -1, 0, 100, and 101 would represent the boundary cases.
=====
It is commonly thought that three cases should be used when boundary testing (one on the boundary,
 and one on either side to it). However, the case on the valid side of the boundary is redundant,
 and so equivalence partitioning recommends skipping it.

corner case (or pathological case) is a problem or situation that occurs only outside of normal
 operating parameters   specifically one that manifests itself when multiple environmental
variables or conditions are simultaneously at extreme levels, even though each parameter is
within the specified range for that parameter.
+++
Contrast a corner case with an edge case, an issue that occurs only at a (single) maximum or
 minimum parameter. For example, a speaker that distorts audio at maximum volume, even in
the absence of other extreme settings or conditions.
===
edge case: extreme situations that challenge the system
===
edge case vs corner case:
edge case:  is situation arised in system due to only 1 factor reached to its minimum/maxiumm state.
corner: is the problem or situation arised in system which is caused by more than 1 factors
or variables reaching to its minimum/maximum state.
=====
An edge case is where the program logic meets a boundary condition. A corner case is where
you meet more than one boundary condition at once.
======
Boundary testing or boundary value analysis, is where test cases are generated using the extremes of
the input domain, e.g. maximum, minimum, just inside/outside boundaries, typical values, and error
values.
----
boundary values usually contain mininum, maximum, and just inside the outside boundaries.

Behavior driven development (or BDD) is an agile software development technique that encourages
 collaboration between developers, QA and non-technical or business participants in a software project.
++
BDD focuses on obtaining a clear understanding of desired software behaviour through discussion
 with stakeholders. It extends TDD by writing test cases in a natural language that non-programmers can read.

six thinking hats
The de Bono Hats system (also known as "Six Hats" or "Six Thinking Hats") is a thinking tool for
 group discussion and individual thinking.
+++++++++
Six distinct states are identified and assigned a color:

    * Questions (White) - considering purely what information is available, what are the facts?
    * Emotions (Red) - instinctive gut reaction or statements of emotional feeling (but not any justification)
    * Bad points judgment (Black) - logic applied to identifying flaws or barriers, seeking mismatch
    * Good points judgment (Yellow) - logic applied to identifying benefits, seeking harmony
    * Creativity (Green) - statements of provocation and investigation, seeing where a thought goes
    * Thinking (Blue) - thinking about thinking

The Maxim of Quantity: do not leave out details

N+1 select problem
let's say you have a collection of persons and you want to get the address of each person.
first, you get all the persons: select name from person_table;
then for each person, you get an address: select address from address_table where person_name = ?
hence N+1
solution: use joins
select person_table.name, address_table.address
    from person_table left join address_table on (person_table.name = address_table.person_name);
----
Most ORMs have lazy-loading enabled by default, so queries are issued for the parent record, and
then one query for EACH child record.
---
N+1 select problem: it means issuing one query for the parent record and N queries to get each of the
child record.

You're falling asleep, then suddenly snap awake. There's a term for that: hypnagogic startle or hypnic jerk.

Fermi problem, Fermi estimate
is an estimation problem designed to teach dimensional analysis, approximation, and the importance of clearly identifying one's assumptions
such problems typically involve making justified guesses about quantities that seem impossible to compute given limited available information.
e.g "How many piano tuners are there in Chicago?

Fermi paradox is the apparent contradiction between high estimates of the probability of the
 existence of extraterrestrial civilizations and the lack of evidence for, or contact with, such civilizations.

wire protocol
refers to a way of getting data from point to point: A wire protocol is needed if more than one application
has to interoperate.
the mechanism for transmitting data from point a to point b
===
In a network, it is the mechanism for transmitting data from point a to point b. It often refers
to a distributed object protocol such as SOAP, CORBA or RMI, which is software only and which
 invokes the running of programs on remote servers.
===
The term is a bit confusing, because it sounds like the physical layer (layer 1) of the network
 that places the bits "onto the wire." In some cases, it may refer to this layer; however, it
generally refers to protocols higher than the physical layer or even the next higher data link
layer (layer 2) such as Ethernet and ATM.

examples of wire protocols are
    * IIOP for CORBA
    * JRMP for RMI
    * SOAP for Web Services
      AMQP for Message Oriented Middleware

DOM:
The XML DOM defines a standard way for accessing and manipulating XML documents.
The DOM presents an XML document as a tree-structure.

XPath:
seven kinds of nodes: element, attribute, text, namespace, processing-instruction, comment, and document nodes.

rostrum: a platform for public speaking

Web API
a defined set of HTTP request messages along with a definition of the structure of response messages, typically expressed in JSON or XML.
Web APIs allow the combination of multiple services into new applications known as mashups

Web Services allow programs written in different languages on different platforms to communicate
 with each other in a standards-based way

Long on style, short on substance

want for nothing: not to lack anything; to have everything one needs or desires
The Smiths don't have much money, but their children seem to want for nothing.

consolidation/groupage:
Combining several smaller shipments into a full container load or a large shipment to avail of better freight rates.

In shipping, breakbulk cargo or general cargo is a term that covers a great variety of goods
 that must be loaded individually, and not in intermodal containers nor in bulk as with oil or grain.

Bulk cargo is commodity cargo that is transported unpackaged in large quantities. This cargo
is usually dropped or poured, with a spout or shovel bucket, as a liquid or as a mass of
 relatively small solids (e.g. grain, coal), into a bulk carrier ship's hold, railroad car,
or tanker truck/trailer/semi-trailer body. Smaller quantities (still considered "bulk") can
 be boxed (or drummed) and palletised. Bulk cargo is classified as liquid or dry.

POSIX
"Portable Operating System Interface for uni-X",
a set of standards for operating systems
Ideally, a developer should have to write a program only once to run on all POSIX-compliant systems.
The POSIX specifications describe an operating system that is similar to, but not necessarily the same as, Unix.

JPA: embeddable
a relationship where the target object's data is embedded in the source object's table is
considered an embedded relationship, and the target object is considered an Embeddable object.
An embeddable object cannot be directly persisted, or queried, it can only be persisted or queried in the context of its parent. An embeddable object does not have an id or table.

JPA Orphan removal will ensure that any object no longer referenced from the sourceis deleted
 from the database.

JPA cascading : allows the relationship to be cascaded
If persist() is called on the parent, and the child is also new, it will also be persisted.
used in one-to-one and one-to-many relationships
cascade options: persist, remove, merge, refresh, all
e.g. relationship: Order -> OrderLine.
Cascading the orderLines relationship allows for the Order's -> OrderLines to be persisted,
 removed, merged along with their parent.

lyceum:
hall for public lecture

load factor: used capacity divided by total capacity

bean-managed transaction
the code in the session or message-driven bean explicitly marks the boundaries of the transaction.
 An entity bean cannot have bean-managed transactions; it must use container-managed transactions
instead. Although beans with container-managed transactions require less coding, they have one
limitation: When a method is executing, it can be associated with either a single transaction
 or no transaction at all. If this limitation will make coding your bean difficult, you should
 consider using bean-managed transactions.

Container-Managed Transactions
the EJB container sets the boundaries of the transactions.

JMX : Java Management Extensions
MBean: a java object representing a resource to be managed.
its interface consists of:
	attributes that can be read and written
	operations that can be invoked
	notifications that can be emitted by the MBean

EclipseLink:
session: the facade through which an application accesses EclipseLink functionality
An EclipseLink session provides the primary access to the EclipseLink runtime. It is the means
 by which your application performs all persistence operations with the data source that contains
 persistent objects.

EAV
Conceptually an EAV design involves a single table with three columns, an entity (such as an
olfactory receptor ID), an attribute (such as species, which is actually a pointer into the
 metadata table) and a value for the attribute (e.g., rat). In EAV design, one row stores
 a single fact. In a conventional table that has one column per attribute, by contrast,
 one row stores a set of facts. EAV design is appropriate when the number of parameters
 that potentially apply to an entity is vastly more than those that actually apply to an individual entity.
+++
appropriate when the number of possible attributes is much greater than the number
that will actually apply to a given entity

out-of-band:
In software, describes values of a function which are not in its natural
 range of return values, but are rather signals that some kind of exception has occurred.
 Many C functions, for example, return a nonnegative integral value, but indicate failure
 with an out-of-band return value of -1.
--
refers to communications which occur outside of a previously established communication method or channel.
==
Out-of-band communication is the exchange of call control information in a separate band
from the data or voice stream, or on an entirely separate, dedicated channel

turing machine: An abstract device that can simulate the logic of any conceivable computer algorithm
A programming language that is capable of modeling any possible computation algorithm is said to
be "Turing complete." it could be used to solve any computation problem.

Prototype-based programming is a style of object-oriented programming in which classes
 are not present, and behavior reuse (known as inheritance in class-based languages) is
performed via a process of cloning existing objects that serve as prototypes. This model
 can also be known as classless, prototype-oriented or instance-based programming.
 Delegation is the language feature that supports prototype-based programming.

JSONP: JSON with padding
a pattern of usage allowing a page to request data from a server in a different domain
--
same origin policy:
 a web page served from server1.example.com cannot normally connect to or communicate
 with a server other than server1.example.com.
---
An exception is the HTML <script> element. Exploiting the open policy for <script> elements,
 some pages use them to retrieve JavaScript code that operates on dynamically generated
JSON-formatted data from other origins. This usage pattern is known as JSONP. Requests
 for JSONP retrieve not JSON, but arbitrary JavaScript code. They are evaluated by
 the JavaScript interpreter, not parsed by a JSON parser.
-->
a usage pattern that allows a page to request data from a server in a different domain.
-->
example return value: functionCall({"Name": "Foo", "Id" : 1234, "Rank": 7});
==
<script type="text/javascript"
         src="http://server2.example.com/RetrieveUser?UserId=1234&jsonp=parseResponse">
 </script>
== return payload:
parseResponse({"Name": "Foo", "Id" : 1234, "Rank": 7})
---
JSONP uses the <script> tag exemption from the same origin policy to request JSON from
servers without the same origin.

cross-domain requests: allow a web page to request data from a server in a different domain
#1. JSONP
#2: CORS (cross-origin resource sharing) additional header: Access-Control-Allow-Origin:
CORS: allowing Javascript on a web page to consume a REST API served from a different origin.
servers can implement CORS
--
In the simplest scenario, cross-origin communications starts with a client making a GET, POST, or
HEAD request against a resource on the server. In this scenario, the content type of a POST request
is limited to application/x-www-form-urlencoded, multipart/form-data, or text/plain. The request
includes an Origin header that indicates the origin of the client code.
--
The server will consider the request's Origin and either allow or disallow the request. If the
server allows the request, then it will respond with the requested resource and an
Access-Control-Allow-Origin header in the response. This header will indicate to the client which
client origins will be allowed to access the resource. Assuming that the Access-Control-Allow-Origin
header matches the request's Origin, the browser will allow the request.
--
On the other hand, if Access-Control-Allow-Origin is missing in the response or if it doesn't match
the request's Origin, the browser will disallow the request.

In computer graphics, a sprite  is a two-dimensional image or animation that is integrated
into a larger scene.
===
CSS sprite:
To reduce the number of requests the browser makes to the server, some web designers combine
 numerous small images or icons into a larger image called a sprite sheet.
 CSS is used to display the parts of the composite image to display at different points
in the page. If a page has 10 1 kB images, they can be combined into one 10 kB image,
 downloaded with a single HTTP request, and then positioned with CSS. Reducing the number
 of HTTP requests can make a Web page load much faster.
===
CSS image sprite: a way of combining multiple images into a single image.
The idea was that the computer could fetch a graphic into memory, and then only display parts of
that image at a time, which was faster than having to continually fetch new images. The sprite was
the big combined graphic.

HTML div tag
The <div> tag defines a division or a section in an HTML document.

myopia: a vision problem where light rays entering the eye are brought to a focus
in front of the retina. The end result being the inability to see distant objects.
is a condition in which visual images come to a focus in front of the retina of the eye,
resulting in the inability to see distant objects clearly

hyperopia: a vision problem where light rays entering the eye are brought to a focus
behind the retina. The end result being distant objects are seen more clearly than near objects.

astigmatism: a vision problem where light rays entering the eye are focused on two points
because the cornea is irregularly (not spherically) shaped. The end result is blurry images.
A vision problem where the eye does not focus light evenly.

presbyopia: the inability of the eye to focus on near objects as a person ages.

solar calendar: a calendar whose dates indicate the position of the earth in its orbit
around the sun. If the dates indicate season, it is called tropical solar calendar
(Gregorian calendar).
If the position of the earth is reckoned with respect to the fixed stars, it is
called sidereal solar calendar (Hindu Solar calendar).

ecliptic: the apparent path of the sun as seen from the earth.
If the sun's path is observed from the Earth's reference frame, it appears
 to move around the Earth in a path which is tilted with respect to the spin
 axis at 23.5. This path is called the ecliptic.
---> the sun's path in the sky

ecliptic plane: the plane that contains the orbit of the earth.

celestial sphere: an imaginary sphere of infinite radius concentric with
the earth. on which
all celestial bodies except the Earth are imagined to be projected.
+++
The stars can be imagined to be points of light on a sphere which rotates about the Earth.
 Projecting the Earth's poles and equator out onto this imaginary sphere provides a
 framework for celestial measurement.

The length of a day, which is measured by the time it takes Earth to rotate once on its axis.

mean solar day: the average period of rotation of the earth about its axis
with respect to the sun. defined to be 24 hours.

sidereal day: the period of rotation of the earth about its axis with
respect to the stars.

The celestial equator is a great circle on the imaginary celestial sphere,
 which is actually the plane of the terrestrial equator extended out into
the universe (i.e., it could be constructed by extrapolating the Earth's
equator until it touches the celestial sphere).
the projection of the geographical equator upon the celestial sphere.

great circle: a circle on the surface of a sphere that has
the same circumference as the sphere. a circle on the surface
of a sphere such that the plane containing the circle passes
through the center of the sphere.

the equivalent of latitude: declination
the equivalent of longitude: right ascension (measured in hours, minutes, seconds).
one hour = 15 degrees

Using the celestial sphere as a reference is called sidereal time.
Solar (tropical) time: use the sun as a reference.

tropical year: the length of time that the sun, as viewed from the earth, takes to return
to the same position along the ecliptic. The precise length of time depends on which
point of the ecliptic one chooses.
The time from one fixed point, such as a solstice or equinox,
to the next is called a tropical year (this is a generalization)

The time from one new moon to the next is called a synodic month.

19 years is called a Metonic cycle. 19 tropical years is about 235 synodic months.
Every 19 years, the phases of the moon fall on the same dates.

lunisolar calendar: a calendar whose dates indicate both the moon phase and the time of
the solar year. If the solar year is defined as a tropical year then a lunisolar
calendar will give an indication of the season.
the year coincides with the tropical year and the month coincides with the synodic month.

Chinese calendar: based on a combination of lunar and solar movements.
The lunar cycle is roughly 29.5 days.
Every few years, the lunar calendar is synchronized with the solar year
by adding an extra month.

intercalation: solar year does not have whole number of days. a calendar year must
have a whole number of days. To reconcile the two, one must vary the number of days
in a year. In gregorian calendar, the intercalary day is Feb 29. The solar year does
not have a whole number of months either, so lunisolar calendar must have a variable
number of months in a year.

A constellation is any one of the 88 areas into which the sky  or the celestial sphere  is divided.

The term zodiac denotes an annual cycle of twelve stations along the ecliptic,
the apparent path of the sun across the heavens through the constellations
that divide the ecliptic into twelve equal zones of celestial longitude.
The zodiac is the first known celestial coordinate system.
Zodiac: represents 12 constellations.

	raises LDL and lowers HDL.
valence shell: the outermost electron shells.
free radical: has an unpaired electron in the valence shell. highly reactive.
oxidize: to lose an electron
oxidant (oxidizing agent): tends to oxidize other substances (i.e., steal electrons from other substances)
	A substance that gains electrons in a redox chemical reaction.
reduce: to gain an electron

oxidation is better defined as an increase in oxidation number, and reduction as a decrease in oxidation number.

Substances that have the ability to oxidize other substances are said to be oxidative
and are known as oxidizing agents, oxidants or oxidizers. Put another way, the oxidant
 removes electrons from another substance, and is thus reduced itself. And because
it "accepts" electrons it is also called an electron acceptor.

Substances that have the ability to reduce other substances are said to be reductive
and are known as reducing agents, reductants, or reducers. Put in another way, the
reductant transfers electrons to another substance, and is thus oxidized itself.
And because it "donates" electrons it is also called an electron donor.

antioxidant: reduce oxidative damage to cells. donate electrons to free radicals.
An antioxidant is a molecule capable of slowing or preventing the oxidation of other molecules.
Oxidation is a chemical reaction that transfers electrons from a substance to an oxidizing agent.
Oxidation reactions can produce free radicals, which start chain reactions that damage cells.
Antioxidants terminate these chain reactions by removing free radical intermediates, and
inhibit other oxidation reactions by being oxidized themselves. As a result, antioxidants
are often reducing agents such as thiols or polyphenols.

plant cells have walls. cell wall is composed of cellulose, hemicellulose and pectin.
Lignin fills the spaces in the cell wall between cellulose, hemicellulose and pectin components.
Lignin makes wood stiff and trees stand upright
Paper is made from wood, which is made up mainly of white cellulose. Wood also has a lot
of a dark substance in it called lignin, which ends up in the paper, too, along with the
cellulose. The exposure of lignin to air and sunlight is what turns paper yellow.

rate is 2400 bits/s.
channel capacity: the amount of information that can be reliably transmitted over a channel.

parallax: An apparent change in the direction of an object, caused by a change
in observational position that provides a new line of sight.

Precession refers to a change in the direction of the axis of a rotating object.

A gyroscope is a device for measuring or maintaining orientation,
based on the principle of conservation of angular momentum. The
essence of the device is a spinning wheel on an axle. The device,
once spinning, tends to resist changes to its orientation due to
the angular momentum of the wheel. In physics this phenomenon is
also known as gyroscopic inertia or rigidity in space.

UML: a language for visualizing, specifying, constructing,
and documenting the artifacts of a software system.

a class is used to model an abstraction drawn from the vocabulary
of the problem space or the solution space.

interface: a collection of operations that specify the service
of a class or component.

instance: a concrete manifestation of an abstraction to which a set of
operations may be applied and which may have a state that stores
the effects of the operation.

stereotype: an extension of the vocabulary of the UML.

polymorphism:
In object-oriented programming, the ability of different objects to respond, each in its own way,
to the same message.
types of polymorphism:
(1) overloading, aka ad-hoc polymorphism
(2) type coercion
(3) parametric polymorphism: java generics, C++ templates, a method that can accept any type.
     used a lot in functional programming.
(4) subtype/inclusion polymorphism: when a name represents instances of many different classes
    that share a common superclass

An objects class defines how the object is implemented.
In contrast, an objects type only refers to its interface.
Class inheritance defines an objects implementation in terms of another objects implementation.
Type inheritance describes when an object can be used in place of another
Inheritance: a language feature that allows you to derive a new class from an existing class.
inheritance: object types are organized in a class hierarchy.

encapsulation:
The localization of knowledge within a module. Because objects encapsulate data and
implementation, the user of an object can view the object as a black box that provides services.
Programming technique that hides the implementation of an operation from its users behind
an abstract interface. This allows the implementation to be updated or changed without
 impacting the users of the interface.
--- data and behavior are package together.

default:
A particular setting or value for a variable that is assigned automatically
 by an operating system and remains in effect unless canceled or overridden by the operator.
A situation or condition that obtains in the absence of active intervention

Modeling is a central part of all the activities that
lead up to the deployment of good software. We
build models to communicate the desired structure and
behavior of our system. We build models to visualize
and control the system's architecture. We build models
to better understand the system we are building, often
exposing opportunities for simplification and reuse.
And we build models to manage risk.

a model is a simplification of reality.
--
modeling is the representation of reality in an abstract way.

principles of modeling:
1. The choice of what models to create has a profound influence
 on how a problem is attacked and how a solution is shaped.
2. Every model may be expressed at different levels of precision.
3. The best models are connected to reality.
4. No single model or view is sufficient. Every nontrivial
system is best approached through a small set of nearly
independent models with multiple viewpoints.

aims:
1. Models help us to visualize a system as it is or as we want it to be.
2. Models permit us to specify the structure or behavior of a system.
3. Models give us a template that guides us in constructing a system.
4. Models document the decisions we have made.

We build models of complex systems because we cannot comprehend such a system in its entirety.

To understand the architecture of such a system, you need
several complementary and interlocking views: a use case
 view (exposing the requirements of the system), a design
 view (capturing the vocabulary of the problem space and
the solution space), an interaction view (showing the
 interactions among the parts of the system and between
 the system and the environment), an implementation view
 (addressing the physical realization of the system), and
 a deployment view (focusing on system engineering issues).
 Each of these views may have structural, as well as
 behavioral, aspects. Together, these views represent
the blueprints of software.

model: an interpretation of reality that abstracts the aspects relevant
to solving the problem at hand and ignores extraneous details.

Systems design is the process or art of defining the hardware
 and software architecture, components, modules, interfaces,
and data for a computer system to satisfy specified requirements.

Abstraction is the process of reducing the information
content of a concept, or of an observation of an empirical
 phenomenon, typically in order to retain only information
which is relevant for a particular purpose. For example,
abstracting a leather soccer ball to a ball retains only
the information on general ball attributes and behaviour.
 Similarly, abstracting happiness to an emotional state
reduces the amount of information conveyed about the emotional state.

is the elimination of the irrelevant and the amplification of the essential.

Abstraction is what we use to manage complexity. We build something of significant complexity, we
mask its inner workings, and we expose what we think is necessary for interacting with it.
--
abstraction: represents something that is not an inherent quality. a way of hiding overwhelming detail.

----
omitting certain kinds of detail in order to emphasise others
"The ability to simplify means to eliminate the unnecessary so that the necessary may speak"

aggregation: composite aggregation vs shared aggregation
composition: the part cannot exist on its own

Systems analysis is the science dealing with analysis of
complex, large scale systems and the interactions within those systems.

A business analyst (BA) is responsible for analyzing the business
 needs of their clients and stakeholders to help identify business
problems and propose solutions. Within the systems
 development life cycle domain, the BA typically performs
a liaison function between the business side of an enterprise
and the information technology department or external service providers.

Requirements analysis encompasses all of the tasks that
go into the instigation, scoping and definition of a new or altered system.
Identify the needs or requirements of a client.

Popular architectural styles are often a product of the weaknesses of their predecessors.

OEM: are manufacturers who resell another company's product under
their own name and branding.
While an OEM is similar to a VAR (value-added reseller),
it refers specifically to the act of a company rebranding
 a product to its own name and offering its own warranty,
support and licensing of the product. The term is really
a misnomer because OEMs are not the original manufacturers;
they are the customizers.
OEM was an adjective used to describe a company that produced
 hardware to be marketed under another company's brand

VAR: typically load applications or proprietary software
onto computers and may also incorporate third-party options
to design a complete solution for a client. This "value-added"
system is often customized for a specific application, but
is sold to the VAR's customer base under the original design
 manufacturer brand; with that manufacturer's warranty,
 support, and license agreements.

holding company: Company formed for the purpose of owning or controlling other companies.

c/o: care of: Through someone, by way of someone, as in I sent the gift
 in care of your parents. This phrase indicates that something is
to be delivered to someone at someone else's address.

organic growth: A company is said to be growing organically when it is
increasing the turnover of its existing business.
Contrast this with a company that is growing by acquiring other companies.
The growth rate that a company can achieve by increasing output
and enhancing sales. This excludes any profits or growth
acquired from takeovers, acquisitions or mergers. Takeovers,
 acquisitions and mergers do not bring about profits generated
 within the company, and therefore, are not considered organic.
Organic growth represents the true growth for the core of the company.
 It is a good indicator of how well management has used its internal
 resources to expand profits. Organic growth also identifies whether
managers have used their skills to improve the business.

boilerplate: standard formulations uniformly found in certain types
of legal documents or news stories.

raised pavement marker: Stimsonite marker, botts' dot.

an XML namespace is a collection of element type and attribute names.

URI: a string of characters which identiies a resource. it can come in one of two flavors: URL or URN:
URL: a unique address for a file on the internet. URL is a type of URI.
URN: urn:<namespace identifier (NID)>:<namespace specific string (NSS)>
An URI locator is known as URL.

serialization: The process of converting the data in an object to XML (or byte stream)
is called serialization. The reverse of serialization, loading XML into the object,
is called deserialization.

Curb weight is the total weight of an automobile with standard equipment,
motor oil, coolant, a full tank of fuel and not loaded with either passengers or cargo.

A gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) is the maximum allowable total weight
of a road vehicle that is loaded to capacity, including the weight of the
vehicle itself plus fuel, passengers, cargo,

Dry weight: the weight of an automobile or motorcycle with standard equipment,
no motor oil, coolant or fuel and not loaded with either passengers or cargo.

far be it from me to do something:
it is not my responsibility to do this...
something that you say when you are giving advice or criticizing someone
and you want to seem polite.
e.g., Far be it from me to tell you what to do, but don't you think you should apologize?

Impedance matching is the practice of attempting to make the output impedance
of a source equal to the input impedance of the load to which it is ultimately
connected, usually in order to maximise the power transfer and minimise reflections from the load.

Impedance mismatch is a term in systems analysis which describes
an inadequate or excessive ability of one system to accommodate
input from another.

Object-relational impedance mismatch: refers to the difficulty in
mapping tables in the relational database to an object model.

severability: If any part of this agreement is legally declared invalid
or unenforceable, all other parts of this agreement are still valid and enforceable.

law of demeter: principle of least knowledge. a design guideline for software
development, particularly OO. "Talk to your immediate friends". a given object
should assume as little as possible about the structure and properties of other
objects.

QoS:
a networking term that specifies a guaranteed throughput level.
---
In the fields of packet-switched networks and computer networking,
the traffic engineering term Quality of Service (QoS) refers to control
 mechanisms that can provide different priority to different users or
 data flows, or guarantee a certain level of performance to a data
 flow in accordance with requests from the application program.
The term Quality of Service is sometimes used as a quality
measure with many alternative definitions.
The goal of QoS is to provide guarantees on the ability of a network to deliver predictable results.
Elements of network performance within the scope of QoS often
include availability (uptime), bandwidth (throughput), latency (delay), and error rate.
QoS involves prioritization of network traffic.
QoS: provides guaranteed timely delivery of specific application data or resources
 to a particular destination or destinations.
--
Class of service: classifying network traffic into groups.
--
QoS level is the agreement between the publisher and the receiver of a message about the guarantees
for delivering the message.
---
QoS: the measurable end-to-end performance properties of a network service (quantifying
network performance). common properties: throughput, delay, packet jitter, error rate,

Bandwidth in computer networking refers to the data rate supported by a network connection or interface.
Bandwidth represents the capacity of the connection
the capacity of a communications channel.

throughput: Output or production, as of a computer program, over a period of time.
In communication networks, such as Ethernet or packet radio, throughput is the average rate of
successful message delivery over a communication channel. usually in bits per second

SOAP performance:
    * Extracting the SOAP envelope from the SOAP packet is time-expensive.
    * Parsing the contained XML information in the SOAP envelope using a XML parser is also time-expensive.
    * There is not much optimization possible with XML data.
    * SOAP encoding rules make it mandatory to include typing information in all
	the SOAP messages sent and received.
    * Encoding binary data in a form acceptable to XML results in overhead of
	additional bytes added as a result of the encoding as well as processor
	 overhead performing the encoding/decoding.

nanotechnology:
A branch of science and engineering devoted to the design and production
of extremely small electronic devices and circuits built from individual atoms and molecules.

prolepsis: The anticipation and answering of an objection or argument before one's opponent has put it forward.

gregorian calendar: Years in the calendar are numbered from the traditional birth year of Jesus.
named after Pope Gregory XIII. Decreed in 1582. By that time, spring equinox was on Mar 10. Skipped
ten days in 1582. Adopted by UK in 1752 (skipped 11 days). motivated by the calculation of the date
of Easter (the first sunday after the first full moon on or after the spring equinox). repeat
every 400 years. 97 leap years in 400 years. Julian calendar has 100 leap years in 400 years.
Leap years are all years divisible by 4, with the exception of those divisible by 100, but not by 400.

Anno Domini: latin: in the year of our lord.

The Common Era, also known as the Current Era, is the period of measured time beginning with the year 1 on the Gregorian calendar.

equinox: the equinox happens when the Sun is at one of two opposite points on
the celestial sphere where the celestial equator and ecliptic intersect.
In a wider sense, the equinoxes are the two days each year when the center
 of the Sun spends an equal amount of time above and below the horizon at every location on Earth.
The sun is directly above the equator at equinox.
Visualization: there is a location on the surface of the earth where the sun
reaches an altitude of 90 degree. This location moves from north to south
and then back. At equinox, this location is on the equator. At solstice, this
location reaches its most northerly/southerly latitude.
On the day of an equinox, the geometric center of the Sun's disk crosses the equator.
+++
the moment in time when there is a location on the equator where the sun is directly overhead.

Twilight is the time before sunrise or after sunset when sunlight scattered in the upper
atmosphere illuminates the lower atmosphere and the surface of the Earth.
Civil twilight begins in the morning when the center of the Sun is less than 6
below the horizon, and ends at sunrise. Evening civil twilight begins at sunset
and ends when the center of the Sun is more than 6 below the horizon.
+++
dawn: the beginning of morning twilight.
sunrise: is the instant at which the upper edge of the Sun appears above the horizon in the east.
dusk: the end of evening twilight.
sunset: the moment the trailing edge of the sun's disk disappears below the horizon in the west.
twilight: the time between dawn and sunrise, and the time between sunset and dusk.
+++
astronomical dawn: formally defined as the time at which the sun is 18 degrees below the horizon in the morning
nautical dawn: formally defined as the time at which the sun is 12 degrees below the horizon in the morning
civil dawn: formally defined as the time at which the sun is 6 degrees below the horizon in the morning

tropic of cancer: It is the farthest northern latitude at which the sun can
appear directly overhead at noon, an event which occurs on the June solstice.
It is difficult to specify an exact location for both tropic circles because
the obliquity of the ecliptic varies between 22.5 and 24.5 with a 41,000 year periodicity.

The northern solstice is in June on Earth, when the sun is directly over the Tropic of Cancer in the Northern Hemisphere,

"Never increase, beyond what is necessary, the number of entities required to explain anything"
--- William of Ockham (1285-1349)
Occam's razor:
In other words, when multiple competing theories are equal in other respects, the
 principle recommends selecting the theory that introduces the fewest assumptions
and postulates the fewest hypothetical entities.
"when you have two competing theories which make exactly the same predictions, the one that is simpler is the better."

Aesthetics (also spelled esthetics) is a branch of philosophy called value theory or
axiology, which is the study of sensory or sensori-emotional values,
 sometimes called judgments of sentiment and taste.

public key cryptography:
sender uses recipient's public key to encrypt the message.
recipient uses recipient's private key to decrypt the message.

digital signature: sender encrypts the message using his private key.
Digital signature schemes normally give two algorithms, one for signing which involves the user's
secret or private key, and one for verifying signatures which involves the user's public key.
 The output of the signature process is called the "digital signature."
signing: sender encrypt using sender's private key.
verifying: recipient uses sender's public key.
digital signature: lets the recipient of information verify the information's
origin, and also verify that the information was not tampered with.

The phrase "Pot calling the kettle black" is an idiom, used to accuse another
speaker of hypocrisy, in that the speaker disparages the subject in a way that
 could equally be applied to him or her. In former times cast iron pots and
 kettles were quickly blackened from the soot of the fire. If personified
into animate objects, the pot would then be hypocritical to insult the
 kettle's colour. The phrase "It takes one to know one" has a similar meaning.

Hypocrisy is the act of condemning another person, when the critic is guilty of the same
thing that is being condemned.

political action committee, is the name commonly given to a private group organized to elect or
defeat government officials in order to promote legislation, often supporting the group's special interests.
A group organized to raise money for their favorite political candidates.

Being carbon neutral, or carbon neutrality, refers to the practice of balancing carbon dioxide
released into the atmosphere from burning fossil fuels, wood, or other sources; with practices
that remove or sequestor carbon from the atmosphere, and use of renewable energy that creates
a similar amount of useful energy without releasing carbon, so that the net carbon emissions are zero.
(carbon offset)

Carbon offsetting is the act of reducing ("offsetting") greenhouse gas emissions.
A well-known example is the planting of trees to compensate for the
greenhouse gas emissions from personal air travel. The idea of paying
 for emission-reductions elsewhere instead of reducing by own actions
is also known from the closely related concept of emissions trading.

carbon footprint: a measure of the impact human activities have on the environment, in terms
of the amount of carbon dioxide produced. A measure of the amount of CO2 emitted
through the combustion of fossil fuels; in the case of an individual, as part of
their daily lives.

The earth's rotation is slowing due to tidal deceleration (gravitational pull from the moon).
The rotation increases due to melting glaciers (water flows from high elevation to low
elevation). The net result is still a decrease in rotational speed.

Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) is a high-precision atomic time standard.
Leap seconds are added to or subtracted from UTC to keep it within 0.9 seconds of UT1.

Universal Time (UT) is a timescale based on the rotation of the Earth. It is
a modern continuation of the Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), i.e., the mean solar time
 on the meridian of Greenwich, England, which is the conventional 0-meridian for
 geographic longitude. GMT is sometimes used, incorrectly, as a synonym for UTC.
The old GMT has been split, in effect, into UTC and UT1.

Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) is a term originally referring to mean solar time
at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich in England. It is now often used to refer
to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) when this is viewed as a time zone,
although strictly UTC is an atomic time scale which only approximates GMT
in the old sense. It is also used to refer to Universal Time (UT), which is the
astronomical concept that directly replaced the original GMT.

Solar time is based on the idea that when the sun reaches its highest point in the sky, it is noon.
The time measured by Earth's rotation relative to the Sun.
a reckoning of the passage of time based on the sun's position in the sky.

Apparent solar time is based on the apparent solar day, which is the interval between two
successive returns of the Sun to the local meridian. Solar time can be measured by a sundial.
Apparent solar time (or true or real solar time) is the time indicated by the Sun on a sundial,
while mean solar time is the average as indicated by clocks.
The average time taken for the sun to return to its highest point is 24 hours.
apparent solar day: the time interval between successive passages of the sun over a local
meridian: not constant because of earth's axial tilt and elliptical shape of earth's orbit.

Mean solar time is artificial clock time adjusted via observations of the diurnal rotation
of the fixed stars to agree with average apparent solar time. The length of a mean solar
 day is a constant 24 hours throughout the year. A time based on a hypothetical sun
moving uniformly along the celestial equator.
Mean solar time, kept by most clocks and watches, is the solar time that
would be measured by observation if the Sun traveled at a uniform apparent speed throughout the year.
To  remedy  the  situation  created  by  apparent  solar  time,  mean  solar  time was
 introduced.  Mean  solar  time  is  based  on  a  fictional  Sun  that
is considered to move at a constant rate of 360 in 24 hours along the celestial  meridian.
 One  mean  day  is  24  hours  in  length,  each  hour consisting of 60 minutes,
and each minute consisting of 60 seconds.

mean sun : an imaginary sun moving uniformly along the celestial equator.

The equation of time is the difference, over the course of a year, between time as read from a sundial and a clock.
The difference between apparent solar time and mean solar time.
The sundial can be ahead (fast) by as much as 16 min 33 s (around November 3)
or fall behind by as much as 14 min 6 s (around February 12).

TAI: international atomic time. not adjusted for leap seconds.
initially, in 1972: TAI - UTC = 10 seconds
as of 2007, total # of leap seconds: 23
	therefore, TAI - UTC = 33 seconds
TAI = UT1 on jan 1 1958
as of 2013: TAI - UTC = 35 seconds

SI second is based on the transition between two energy states in caesium atoms.
defined as a certain number of atomic vibrations.
The SI second that is counted by atomic time standards is currently defined
in such a way that its length matches the nominal second of 1/86400 of a mean solar day between 1750 and 1892.

Cross-sell is a marketing term for the practice of suggesting related products
or services to a customer who is considering buying something. (e.g., would you like fries with that?)

Up-sell is a marketing term for the practice of suggesting higher priced products or
 services to a customer who is considering a purchase. (e.g., Would you like to biggie-size that?")

loose coupling: means a reduction in assumptions between components.

In computer science, a reference is an object containing information which refers to
 data stored elsewhere, as opposed to containing the data itself. Accessing the
value referred to by a reference is called dereferencing it.
More generally, a reference can be considered as a piece of data that allows
unique retrieval of another piece of data.
A reference may be compared to the address of a house. It is a small identifier
 from which it is possible to find a potentially much larger object.
Finding a house based on its address is analogous to dereferencing a reference.
Dereference a pointer.

32-bit: Most CPUs are currently (as of 2005) designed so that the contents of
a single integer register can store the address (location) of any datum in
the computer's virtual memory. Therefore, the total number of addresses
in the virtual memory  the total amount of data the computer can keep
in its working area  is determined by the width of these registers.
32-bit --> 4G of memory.

load balancer: A load balancer can be used to increase the capacity of a server
 farm beyond that of a single server. It can also allow the service to
continue even in the face of server down time due to server failure or server maintenance.
A load balancer consists of a virtual server (also referred to as vserver or VIP) which,
in turn, consists of an IP address and port. This virtual server is bound to a number
 of physical services running on the physical servers in a server farm. These physical
 services contain the physical server's IP address and port. A client sends a request
 to the virtual server, which in turn selects a physical server in the server farm
and directs this request to the selected physical server. Load balancers are sometimes referred to as "directors"

A QAM tuner is a device present in some digital televisions and similar
devices which enables direct reception of digital cable channels without
 the use of a set-top box. QAM stands for "quadrature amplitude modulation,"
the format by which digital cable channels are encoded and transmitted via
 cable. QAM tuners can be likened to the cable equivalent of an ATSC tuner
 which is required to receive over-the-air (OTA) digital channels broadcast
 by local television stations.
Most cable companies don't encrypt the digital signals that they pick up from local broadcasters.

SDTV: 480i, or 525i (When they broadcast video information, they need
to give CRT-type TVs time to reset the electronic beam to the top
of the screen so it can get ready to paint the next sequence of
lines. So they build in an interframe gap that equals about 45
lines. There is no picture information in this 45 line gap it
is there just to allow the TV time to get ready to receive the next frame).
30 frames per second. 1/60 second in one pass.

EDTV: 480p, or 525p

HDTV: 1080i and 720p

ATSC: used to receive HD signals over the air.

The biggest difference between HDTV signals on a cable system and those
 broadcast over the air revolves around the system used to modulate an
 HDTV signal for transmission as radio-frequency signals across the cable system.
HD signals are modulated for transmission.
Broadcast HDTV uses a system called 8-VSB (vestigial sideband), while cable
usually uses a system called QAM (quadrature amplitude modulation).

For a lot of people, HDTV cable service comes through an HDTV set-top box
(or cable box) that has a built-in QAM tuner.
the channels are also encrypted (scrambled)

In some cable systems, the local broadcast HDTV channels are transmitted across the cable system unencrypted.

*  TVs are being built as digital-cable-ready(DCR) - just as regular analog TVs have been built as
cable-ready for analog cable for years. These DCR TVs have a QAM tuner built-in and a slot for a
"smart card" called the CableCARD.

* Some cable companies rent these CableCARDs to their customers. A customer
 with a CableCARD and a DCR HDTV can simply plug the CableCARD into the HDTV -
the card basically gives your TV "permission" to unscramble encrypted premium channels.

modulation is the process of varying a periodic waveform, i.e. a tone, in order to use that signal to convey a message.

tuner
A tuner is a circuit module or free-standing equipment which detects radio-frequency (RF)
signals usually of low amplitude and amplifies them and converts them to a form suitable for further processing.

radio tuner:
receives radio broadcasts and converts them into audio-frequency signals
 which can be fed into an amplifier driving a loudspeaker.

the time it takes light to fly across 400k km to earth.
you see them as they were a billionth of a second earlier.

relativistic aberration: The shape, position or orientation of an object
seen by a person moving near the speed of light can be quite unusual, and
even different to what is predicted by the non-optical aspects of Einstein's
theory of special relativity, such as length contraction. This is due to
the purely visual effects of angular compression and distortion.
Angular compression:
As we travel faster, light appears to come at us from different angles.
as we travel close to the speed of light, the angles of light coming towards us
from all sides appear to contract, such that more light approaches us from in front.
Among other things, this has the effect of allowing a moving observer
 to see behind them. Watch what happens to an arrow originally behind
the green dot as it accelerates. Aberration allows objects which normally
 make an obtuse angle (greater than 90 degrees) with the direction of
 motion to be wrapped forward into the field of view.
Distortion:
 is a visual effect that arises because the speed of light is not infinite,
so light takes some small amount of time to travel a certain distance.
Therefore, light from distant objects must leave earlier in time than
light from closer objects in order for that light to enter an observer's eye at the same time.
When things move at relativistic speeds, however, this effect is noticeable on a
more local scale. This is because in the short time between seeing one part
of an object and another, its enormous speed allows it to move a significant
distance. This has the effect of making objects appear distorted; possible bent,
 curved or twisted. For example, long rods may appear as parabolic arcs
bending away from the viewer, and cubes can present curved edges or
 non-parallel surfaces. Surprisingly, distortion cancels the effect
 of length contraction in the case of a sphere, which will always
 look circular to a moving observer.

pilot: One who, though not belonging to a ship's company, is licensed to conduct a ship into and out of port or through dangerous waters.
  A television program produced as a prototype of a series being considered for adoption by a network.
pilot light: small auxiliary gas burner that provides a flame to ignite a larger gas burner

A hull is the body of a ship or boat.

In boats and ships, keel can refer to either of two parts: a structural element, or a hydrodynamic element.
A structural keel is a large beam which the hull of a ship is built around.
The keel runs in the middle of the ship, from the bow to the stern, and
 serves as the foundation or spine of the structure, providing the
major source of structural strength of the hull.

Displacement is the actual total weight of the vessel. It is often expressed
in long tons or in metric tons, and is calculated simply by multiplying the
volume of the hull below the waterline (ie. the volume of water it is displacing) by the density of the water.
The word "displacement" arises from the basic physical law, discovered by Archimedes,
 that the weight of a floating object equates exactly to that of the water which
 would otherwise occupy the "hole in the water" displaced by the ship.

Lightship measures the actual weight of the ship with no fuel, passengers, cargo, water, etc. on board.

Deadweight (often abbreviated as DWT for deadweight tonnes) is the displacement at any loaded
 condition minus the lightship weight. It includes the crew, passengers, cargo, fuel, water,
 and stores. Like Displacement, it is often expressed in long tons or in metric tons.

Bulk cargo is commodity cargo that is transported unpackaged in large quantities.
These cargos are usually dropped or poured, with a spout or shovel bucket, as a
 liquid or solid, into a bulk carrier's hold, railroad car, or tanker truck/trailer/semi-trailer
 body. Bulk cargos are classified as liquid or dry.
dry bulk cargo: coal, grain, cement
liquid bulk cargo: petroleum, gasoline

A bulk carrier, bulk freighter, or bulker is a merchant ship used to transport
unpackaged bulk cargo such as cereals, coal, ore, and cement.

Roll-on/roll-off (RORO or ro-ro) ships are designed to carry wheeled cargo such as
automobiles, trailers or railroad cars. This is in contrast to lo-lo (lift on-lift off)
vessels which use a crane to load and unload cargo.

The draft (or draught) of a ship's hull is the vertical distance between the waterline and the
bottom of the hull (keel), with the thickness of the hull included

Tonnage is a measure of the size or cargo capacity of a ship (in units of 100 cubic feet.)

Suezmax is a naval architecture term for the largest ships capable of transiting the Suez Canal fully loaded,

Ships classified as Panamax are of the maximum dimensions that will fit through
the locks of the Panama Canal. This size is determined by the dimensions of the
lock chambers, and the depth of the water in the canal.

A lock is a device for raising and lowering boats between stretches of water of
different levels on river and canal waterways. The distinguishing feature of a
lock is a fixed chamber whose water level can be varied; whereas in a caisson
lock, a boat lift, or on a canal inclined plane, it is the chamber itself
that moves, and is then called a caisson

caisson: A watertight structure within which construction work is carried on under water.

culvert: A sewer or drain crossing under a road or embankment.

A pallet (sometimes called a skid) is a flat transport structure designed to support
 a variety of goods in a stable fashion while being lifted by any mobile forklift,
pallet jack, or other jacking device. The goods are placed on top of the pallet,
 and can be secured to it by straps or stretch-wrapped plastic film.

A Trailer is generally an unpowered vehicle pulled by a powered vehicle. Commonly,
the term trailer refers to such vehicles used for transport of goods and materials.

A semi-trailer is a trailer without a front axle. A large proportion of its weight
is supported either by a road tractor or by a detachable front axle assembly known
 as a dolly or by the tail of another trailer.
A road tractor coupled to a semi-trailer is often called a semi-trailer truck or semi.

Intermodal freight transport involves the transportation of freight in a container
 or vehicle, using multiple modes of transportation (rail, ocean vessel, and truck),
without any handling of the freight itself when changing modes.

Exits will be numbered from south to north and west to east. Each exit number is
determined by the number of miles it is from the beginning of a route. For example,
on Interstate 5, exit No. 1 is just north of the Mexican border and Exit 796 is the
off-ramp before the freeway enters Oregon, 796 miles north of the Mexican border.

loaded for bear: ready and eager to deal with something that is going to be difficult

Cognitive dissonance is a psychological term describing the uncomfortable tension
that may result from having two conflicting thoughts at the same time, or from engaging
in behavior that conflicts with one's beliefs.

Electrical impedance, or simply impedance, describes a measure of opposition
to a sinusoidal alternating current (AC). Electrical impedance extends the
concept of resistance to AC circuits, describing not only the relative
amplitudes of the voltage and current, but also the relative phases.

Impedance is the measure of the amount that some object impedes (or obstructs) the
flow of a current. Impedance might refer to resistance, reactance, or some complex combination of the two.

Impedance matching is the practice of attempting to make the output impedance of
a source equal to the input impedance of the load to which it is ultimately connected,
usually in order to maximize the power transfer and minimize reflections from the load.
 This only applies when both are linear devices. The concept of impedance matching was
originally developed for electrical power,

Electrical resistance is a measure of the degree to which an object opposes an electric current through it

object-relational impedance mismatch: refer to the difficulty encountered when mapping
a relation database model to an object model.

physiological processes.

gore point, gore zone: a triangular piece of land found where roads merge or split.

jersey barrier, jersey wall: separates lanes of traffic (often opposing lanes of traffic) with a goal
of minimizing vehicle crossover in the case of accidents.

hibernation:
Animals enter hibernation during winter to conserve energy by going into a deep sleep-like state.
Mammals, such as gophers, bears, skunks, raccoons, hamsters, and bats, lower their metabolism
and enter a state of torpor, but they are not asleep.
A list of hibernating animals might include the following mammals: Chipmunks, ground squirrels,
echidnas, possums, hedgehogs, hamsters, skunks, bats, prairie dogs, marmots, badgers, and some lemurs.
Among non-mammals, you can find species of lizards, frogs, toads, newts, snakes, turtles, and
insects like bees that hibernate

Torpor is a kind of deep sleep accompanied by drastically lowered body temperature,
heart rate, and breathing. Like a short-term hibernation.

Estivation or aestivation (from Latin aestas, summer) is a rare state of
dormancy similar to hibernation, but during the months of the summer.

Cold-blooded animals (ectotherms) are animals that do not have an internal mechanism
for regulating body temperature, relying instead on solar energy captured by the environment.
 Reptiles, amphibians and fish are examples of cold-blooded animals.
Cold-blooded creatures take on the temperature of their surroundings.
Warm-blooded creatures, like mammals and birds, try to keep the inside of their bodies at a constant temperature.

Warm-bloodedness generally refers to three separate aspects of thermoregulation:
1. Endothermy is the ability of some creatures to control their body temperatures
 through internal means such as muscle shivering, fat burning, and panting
2. Homeothermy is thermoregulation that maintains a stable internal body temperature regardless of external influence
3. Tachymetabolism is the kind of thermoregulation used by creatures that maintain a high resting metabolism

Cold-bloodedness generally refers to three separate areas of thermoregulation:
1. Ectothermy - This refers to creatures that control body temperature through external means
2. Poikilothermy - This refers to creatures whose internal temperatures vary, often matching the ambient temperature of the immediate environment
3. Bradymetabolism - This term refers to creatures with a high active metabolism and a
considerably slower resting metabolism

grasp at straws: Make a desperate attempt at saving oneself.
to seize at any chance, no matter how slight, of saving oneself from calamity.
This metaphoric expression alludes to a drowning person trying to save himself by grabbing at flimsy reeds.

Line-of-sight propagation refers to electro-magnetic radiation or electro-magnetic waves
 travelling in a straight line. The rays or waves are deviated or reflected by obstructions
and cannot travel over the horizon or behind obstacles. Beyond that, material disperses the
rays respectively the energy of the waves

The standard model of particle physics is a theory that describes three of the four
 known fundamental interactions between the elementary particles that make up all matter.
 It is a quantum field theory developed between 1970 and 1973 which is consistent with both
 quantum mechanics and special relativity.
The Standard Model describes approximately 200 elementary particles and their interactions using 6 quarks,
 6 leptons and a few force-carrying particles.
strong force: gluon
electromagnetic: photon
weak nuclear: W+, W-, Z
gravity: graviton (unconfirmed)
two categories of particles: quark and lepton.
lepton (e.g., electron): are immune to the strong force. have no color
quarks have color (a property akin to spin)

boson: force-carrying particle

Refraction is the change in direction of a wave due to a change in its speed. This is
most commonly seen when a wave passes from one medium to another.

Diffraction refers to various phenomena associated with the bending of waves when they
interact with obstacles in their path.

Onomatopoeia: The formation or use of words such as buzz or murmur that imitate the sounds
associated with the objects or actions they refer to.

a particular candidate.
Before the primary or caucus, each candidate on a state's ballot submits the names of
local Democrats who would serve as their delegates at the national convention, if necessary.
However, voters do not directly select presidential nominees in these primaries. Instead,
they choose delegates from their respective states who will attend a national party convention
to nominate a presidential candidate for their party.

fiat currency: money backed by faith (backed by an authority)

gold standard is a monetary system in which the standard economic unit of account is a
fixed weight of gold. Under the gold standard, currency issuers guarantee
to redeem notes, upon demand, in that amount of gold.
In other words, gold standard is a monetary system under which the issuer of a currency
guarantee to redeem the currency for a fixed amount of gold.
history of money: commodity money (in which actual valuable objects are bartered);
representative money (in which paper notes are used represent real commodities stored
elsewhere; fiat money (in which paper notes are backed only by a government.

The theory of the gold standard rests on the idea that inflation is caused by
 an increase in the supply of money, an idea advocated by David Hume, and that
 uncertainty over the future purchasing power of currency depresses business
confidence and leads to reduced trade and capital investment.

advantage: limit inflation disadvantage: Loss of control over economic policy
Prevent the country from printing too much money.
To avoid a gold standard-generated run on the dollar.

Bretton Woods System (1946) created a system of fixed exchange rates that allowed
governments to sell their gold to the United States treasury at the price of $35/ounce.
"The Bretton Woods system ended on August 15, 1971, when President Richard Nixon ended
trading of gold at the fixed price of $35/ounce. Fixed the dollar to gold and fixed
other nations' currencies to the dollar.

The value of money is set by the supply and demand for money and the supply and demand

legislature: An officially elected or otherwise selected body of people vested with the
responsibility and power to make laws for a political unit, such as a state or nation.
Legislatures are known by many names, the most common being parliament and congress,
although these terms also have more specific meanings. The main job of the legislature
is to make and interpret laws. In parliamentary systems of government, the legislature
is formally supreme and appoints the executive. In presidential systems of government,
the legislature is considered a power branch which is equal to, and independent of,
the executive.

In most parliamentary systems, the lower house is the more powerful house while
 the upper house is merely a chamber of advice or review.

A parliamentary system, also known as parliamentarianism (and parliamentarism in
 U.S. English), is distinguished by the executive branch of government being
dependent on the direct or indirect support of the parliament, often expressed
through a vote of confidence. Hence, there is no clear-cut separation of powers
between the executive and legislative branches, leading to a differing set of
 checks and balances compared to those found in a presidential republic.
Parliamentary systems usually have a clear differentiation between the head
of government and the head of state, with the head of government being the
prime minister or premier, and the head of state often being an elected
 (either popularly or through parliament) president or hereditary monarch.

A federation (Latin: foedus, covenant) is a union comprising a number of partially
 self-governing states or regions united by a central ("federal") government. In
a federation, the self-governing status of the component states is typically
constitutionally entrenched and may not be altered by a unilateral decision of the central government.

The form of government or constitutional structure found in a federation is known as federalism.
It can be considered the opposite of another system, the unitary state

The Head of Government is the chief officer of the executive branch of a government,
often presiding over a cabinet. In a parliamentary system, the head of government is
often styled Prime Minister, Premier, etc. In presidential republics or monarchies,
 the head of government may be the same person as the head of state, who is often a president
(of the republic) or a monarch.

head of state: or Chief of state is the generic term for the individual or
collective office that serves as the chief public representative of a monarchic
 or republican nation-state, federation, commonwealth or any other political
 state. His or her role generally includes personifying the continuity and
legitimacy of the state and exercising the political powers, functions and
duties granted the head of state in the country's laws and constitution.
+++
presides over ceremonial functions. usually does not have governing power.

Different countries have different executive systems but in essence four major, generalizing categories can be distinguished:

   1. the non-executive head of state system, in which the head of state does not
	 hold any executive power and mainly plays a symbolic role on behalf of the state;
   2. the parliamentary system, in which the head of state possesses executive
	 power but the exercise of this power is done on the advice of a cabinet;
   3. the presidential (or imperial) system, in which the head of state is also
	the head of government and actively exercises executive power; and,
   4. the semi-presidential system, in which the head of state shares exercise
	of executive power with a head of government.

A presidential system, also called a congressional system, is a system of government
 where an executive branch exists and presides (hence the term) separately from the
legislature, to which it is not accountable and which cannot in normal circumstances dismiss it.

two-round system: runoff voting

A cabinet is a body of high-ranking members of government, typically representing
the executive branch. It can also sometimes be referred to as the Council of Ministers,
an Executive Council or an Executive Committee.
In some countries, particularly those under the Westminster system, the cabinet
collectively decides the government's policy and tactical direction, especially
in regard to legislation passed by the parliament. In countries with a presidential
system, such as the United States, the cabinet does not function as a collective
legislative influence; rather, their primary role is as an unofficial advisory
council to the head of government, consisting of the heads of the executive departments
 they are appointed to lead.

A coalition government, or coalition cabinet, is a cabinet of a parliamentary government
in which several parties cooperate. The usual reason given for this arrangement is
that no party on its own can achieve a majority in the parliament.

Single transferable vote (STV) is a preferential voting system designed to minimize
 wasted votes and provide proportional representation while ensuring that votes are
explicitly for candidates rather than party lists. It achieves this by using multi-seat
constituencies (districts) and by transferring votes that would otherwise be wasted.
 STV initially allocates an individual's vote to his or her most preferred candidate,
 and then subsequently transfers unneeded or unused votes after candidates are either
elected or eliminated, according to the voter's stated preferences

first past the post: winner-takes-all, plurality voting.
The plurality voting system is a single-winner voting system often used to elect
executive officers or to elect members of a legislative assembly which is based on single-member
constituencies.
A voting system in which a single winner is chosen in a given constituency by having
more votes than any other individual representative.
+++
the person receiving the greatest number of votes in each voting region wins.

Proportional representation (sometimes referred to as full representation, or PR), is
a category of electoral formula aiming at a close match between the percentage of votes
 that groups of candidates (grouped by a certain measure) obtain in elections and the
percentage of seats they receive (usually in legislative assemblies).
PR: the number of seats allocated to a group is proportional to the number of votes
received by that group.

parliamentary democracy relies upon the election of representatives from each voting region
 to form a governing body.
The party that holds the majority in parliament is held to be in control, and its leader
becomes the prime minister.
+++
parliamentary representatives are elected by voting regions.

A person is considered LEGALLY blind when the best corrected visual acuity is 20/200
People with a visual field of less than 20 degrees diameter (10 degrees radius) are also considered legally blind

cousin:
A system of degrees and removes is used to describe the relationship between the
two cousins and the ancestor they have in common. The degree (first, second, third
cousin, etc.) indicates the minimum number of generations between either cousin and
the nearest common ancestor; the remove (once removed, twice removed, etc.) indicates
 the number of generations, if any, separating the two cousins from each other.
For example, a person with whom you share a grandparent is your first cousin; someone
with whom you share a great-grandparent is a second cousin. Where your relationship
to the nearest common ancestor is different from your cousin's relationship then the
 term removed is used to indicate this, for example the child of your first cousin
is your first cousin once removed because there is a generation between you.

ceteris paribus a Latin phrase, literally translated as "with other things [being] the same,"
and usually rendered in English as "all other things being equal", "all else being equal"

boundary condition: The set of conditions specified for the solution to
a set of differential equations at the boundary of its domain.
In mathematics, in the field of differential equations, a boundary value problem is
 a differential equation together with a set of additional restraints, called the
boundary conditions. A solution to a boundary value problem is a solution to the
 differential equation which also satisfies the boundary conditions.

The rotation curve of a galaxy can be represented by a graph that plots the orbital
velocity of the stars or gas in the galaxy on the y-axis against the distance from the
 center of the galaxy on the x-axis. Stars revolve around the center of galaxies at a
constant speed over a large range of distances from the center of the galaxy. Thus they
 revolve much faster than would be expected if they were in a free Newtonian potential.
=================
The galaxy rotation problem is this discrepancy between the observed rotation speeds of
 matter in the disk portions of spiral galaxies and the predictions of
Newtonian dynamics considering the visible mass.
=================
One of the theories for explaining this discrepancy is the presence of dark matter.
Galactic rotation curves, which illustrate the velocity of rotation versus the distance
from the galactic center, cannot be explained by only the visible matter.
Hypothetical form of matter for explaining the discrepancy between the observed
speed and the theoretical speed of stars revolving around the center of galaxies.

dark matter halo:
Most of the mass of any galaxy is dominated by a component concentrated at
the centre of the galaxy but dominating its dynamics throughout, known as the dark matter halo.
The presence of dark matter in the halo is demonstrated by its gravitational effect
 on a spiral galaxy's rotation curve. Without large amounts of mass in the extended halo,
the rotational velocity of the galaxy should decrease at large distance from the galactic
core. However, observations of spiral galaxies, particularly radio observations of line
emission from neutral atomic hydrogen (known, in astronomical parlance, as HI), show that
 the rotation curve of most spiral galaxies remains flat far beyond the visible matter.
 The absence of any visible matter to account for these observations implies the presence
 of unobserved (i.e. dark) matter. Asserting that this dark matter does not exist would
 mean that the accepted theory of gravitation (General Relativity) is wrong, something
that could be possible but most scientists would require extensive amounts of compelling evidence before considering it.

dark matter is a hypothetical form of matter that does not emit or reflect enough
electromagnetic radiation to be observed directly, but whose presence can be inferred
 from gravitational effects on visible matter.

corvee: unpaid labor

choke point: A narrow passage, such as a strait, through which shipping must pass;
a point of congestion or obstruction (bottleneck)

Nucleation is the onset of a phase transition in a small region. The phase
transition can be the formation of a bubble or of a crystal from a liquid.
 Creation of liquid droplets in saturated vapor or the creation of gaseous
bubble in a saturated liquid is also characterized by nucleation

Nucleation normally occurs at nucleation sites on surfaces containing
 the liquid or vapor. Suspended particles or minute bubbles also provide
nucleation sites. This is called heterogeneous nucleation. Nucleation without
 preferential nucleation sites is homogeneous nucleation. Homogeneous nucleation
occurs spontaneously and randomly, but it requires superheating or supercooling of the medium.

Supercooling is the process of chilling a liquid below its freezing point, without it becoming solid.
A liquid below its freezing point will crystallize in the presence of a seed
crystal or nucleus around which a crystal structure can form. However, lacking
any such nucleus, the liquid phase can be maintained all the way down to the
temperature at which crystal homogeneous nucleation occurs.

superheating (sometimes referred to as boiling retardation, or boiling delay)
is the phenomenan in which a liquid is heated to a temperature higher than
its standard boiling point, without actually boiling. This can be caused by
 rapidly heating a homogeneous substance while leaving it undisturbed
 (in order to avoid the introduction of bubbles at nucleation sites).

Small particles (seeds) can trigger the separation of the dissolved material
 from the solvent or condensation of the vapor. Seeds triggering the
condensation of vapor are referred to as condensation nuclei, as in the case of water vapor.

Supersaturation refers to a solution that contains more of the
dissolved material than could be dissolved by the solvent under normal
circumstances. It can also refer to a vapor of a compound that has a
higher (partial) pressure than the vapor pressure of that compound.

Carbonated water is a supersaturated solution of carbon dioxide gas in water.
 At the elevated pressure in the bottle, carbon dioxide can dissolve in water
 more than at atmospheric pressure. At atmospheric pressure, the carbon
 dioxide gas escapes very slowly from the supersaturated liquid. This
process may be accelerated by the presence of nucleation sites within
 the solution, such as small bubbles, caused by shaking the bottle,
or another solute, such as sugar powder or a widget. A Diet Coke and
 Mentos eruption is a rather extreme example. Some beverage products
 such as ales and stouts e.g. Guinness rely on this effect to produce
 the 'head' on the surface of the poured product.
Scuba divers' tissues become supersaturated with breathing gases during a dive.
If the diver ascends too fast, these gases form bubbles, resulting in decompression sickness.
In air that is supersaturated with water, water droplets may precipitate upon being disturbed.

Vapor pressure (also known as equilibrium vapor pressure or saturation vapor pressure),
is the pressure of a vapor in equilibrium with its non-vapor phases. All liquids and
solids have a tendency to evaporate to a gaseous form, and all gases have a tendency
to condense back into their original form (either liquid or solid). At any given
temperature, for a particular substance, there is a pressure at which the gas of
that substance is in dynamic equilibrium with its liquid or solid forms. This is
the vapor pressure of that substance at that temperature. The equilibrium vapor
pressure is an indication of a liquid's evaporation rate. It relates to the tendency
 of molecules and atoms to escape from a liquid or a solid.

The boiling point of a liquid is the temperature at which the vapor pressure
 of the liquid equals the environmental pressure surrounding the liquid

Opportunity cost is the cost (sacrifice) incurred by choosing one option over
an alternative one that may be equally desired.
Opportunity cost is the cost of pursuing one choice instead of another.
Every action has an opportunity cost.
Opportunity cost is not restricted to monetary or financial costs: the real
 cost of output forgone, lost time, pleasure or any other benefit that provides
 utility should also be considered.
When economists refer to the "opportunity cost" of a resource, they mean the
value of the next-best alternative use of that resource. If, for
example, you spend time and money going to a movie, you cannot spend that
time at home reading a book, and you can't spend the money on something else.
 If your next-best alternative to seeing the movie is reading the book, then
the opportunity cost of seeing the movie is the money spent plus the pleasure
you forgo by not reading the book.
Scarcity of resources is one of the more basic concepts of economics.
Scarcity necessitates trade-offs, and trade-offs result in an opportunity
cost. While the cost of a good or service often is thought of in monetary
 terms, the opportunity cost of a decision is based on what must be given
up (the next best alternative) as a result of the decision. Any decision
that involves a choice between two or more options has an opportunity cost.

TANSTAAFL is an acronym for the adage "There Ain't No Such Thing As A Free Lunch,"
popularized by science fiction writer Robert A. Heinlein in his 1966 novel
The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress, which discusses the problems caused by
 not considering the eventual outcome of an unbalanced economy.

The parable of the broken window was created by Frdric Bastiat in his 1850
essay Ce qu'on voit et ce qu'on ne voit pas (That Which Is Seen and That Which Is Unseen)
 to illuminate the notion of hidden costs.
Bastiat uses this story to introduce a concept he calls the broken window fallacy,
 which is related to the law of unintended consequences, in that both involve an
incomplete accounting for the consequences of an action.
The parable describes a shopkeeper whose window is broken by a little boy. Everyone
sympathizes with the man whose window was broken, but pretty soon they start to
suggest that the broken window makes work for the glazier, who will then buy
bread, benefiting the baker, who will then buy shoes, benefiting the cobbler,
 etc. Finally, the onlookers conclude that the little boy was not guilty of
vandalism; instead he was a public benefactor, creating economic benefits for everyone in town.
The fallacy of the onlookers' argument is that they considered only the positive
benefits of purchasing a new window, but they ignored the cost to the shopkeeper. As
 the shopkeeper was forced to spend his money on a new window, he obviously could
not have spent it on something else. For example, the shopkeeper may have spent
the money on bread and shoes for himself, but now cannot so enrich the baker and
cobbler because he must fix his window.
Thus, the child did not bring any net benefit to the town. Instead, he made the
town poorer by at least the value of one window, if not more

electoral college:
Under the Electoral College system, we do not elect the President and Vice President through
a direct nation-wide vote. The Presidential election is decided by the combined results
 of 51 State elections (in this context, the term "State" includes DC).
 Your vote helps decide which candidate receives your State's electoral votes.
Generally, the political parties nominate electors at their State party conventions
or by a vote of the party's central committee in each State. Electors are often
selected to recognize their service and dedication to their political party. They
may be State elected officials, party leaders, or persons who have a personal or
political affiliation with the Presidential candidate. Then the voters in each
State choose the electors on the day of the general election.
Electoral votes are awarded on the basis of the popular vote in each State.
If no candidate receives a majority of electoral votes, the House of Representatives
 elects the President from the 3 Presidential candidates who received the most
electoral votes. Each State delegation has one vote. The Senate would elect
the Vice President from the 2 Vice Presidential candidates with the most
electoral votes. Each Senator would cast one vote for Vice President. If
the House of Representatives fails to elect a President by Inauguration
 Day, the Vice-President Elect serves as acting President until the deadlock is resolved in the House.
Maine and Nebraska do not do winner-takes-all
For example, Maine has four electoral votes. Two electors are selected on
the basis of the statewide vote and two are selected according to outcome
 of the vote in each of Maine's two Congressional districts. Nebraska's five
electoral votes are distributed in the same manner:   two based on the statewide
vote, and three based on the results in Congressional districts.
The Electoral College was established by the founding fathers as a compromise between
election of the president by Congress and election by popular vote. The electors are
a popularly elected body chosen by the States and the District of Columbia on the
Tuesday after the first Monday in November
The slates of electors are generally chosen by the political parties.
No Constitutional provision or Federal law requires electors to vote in accordance with
the popular vote in their States.

undivided interest: The interest in property owned by tenants whereby each tenant has
an equal right to enjoy the entire property.
An ownership right to use and possession of a property that is shared among co-owners,
with no one co-owner having exclusive rights to any portion of the property.

deductible: the amount a person must pay first (in addition to the premium) before
insurance coverage will pay for a loss on an insurance claim.
The amount a beneficiary pays out-of-pocket before insurance benefits are paid.
The annual deductible is the amount you are responsible for under the health plan
before the health plan will begin to pay.

copay: copay is usually a flat fee. For example, every time you go to the doctor
 you pay a 25.00 copay for the office visit, regardless of the level of service you receive.
Co-payments are charged and paid at the time you receive certain types of services,
such as office visits, prescription drugs, and emergency room services.
 These charges do not apply to the out-of-pocket maximum??

Coinsurance: coinsurance is a term used for a percentage amount you are responsible for.
For example if your insurance policy is 80/20, where you are responsible for paying 20% of
your bill, the 20% is a coinsurance.
Coinsurance is the percentage of each claim above the deductible that you pay.
 If the coinsurance is 20 percent, you pay for the deductible plus 20% of the covered expenses.
Coinsurance Applies After The Services.

An assisted living facility typically offers more independence and less intensive medical care
a nursing home is a facility designed for someone who needs less care than a
 hospital, but requires daily health care assistance.
Assisted-living: provide assistance with the activities of daily living (cooking,
laundry, etc). not required to provide health care.

Ultra high frequency (UHF) designates a range (band) of electromagnetic waves with
 frequencies between 300 MHz and 3 GHz (3,000 MHz).

Radio waves with frequencies above the UHF band fall into the SHF (Super high frequency)
 and EHF (Extremely high frequency) bands; all of which fall into the Microwave frequency range.

Very high frequency (VHF) is the radio frequency range from 30 MHz to 300 MHz

Common uses for VHF are FM radio broadcast, television broadcast (together with UHF)

VHF propagation characteristics are ideal for short-distance terrestrial communication,
with a range generally somewhat farther than line-of-sight from the transmitter.
 Unlike high frequencies (HF), the ionosphere does not usually reflect VHF radio
and thus transmissions are restricted to the local area (and don't interfere with
transmissions thousands of kilometres away). VHF is also less affected by atmospheric
 noise and interference from electrical equipment than lower frequencies. Whilst it
is more easily blocked by land features than HF and lower frequencies, it is less
 bothered by buildings and other less substantial objects than UHF frequencies.

VHF: TV channel 2-13
VHF:
88-108 MHz: FM radio broadcasting (88-92 non-commercial, 92-108 commercial in the United States)

UHF: TV channel 14-69

DTV transition:
The move would free 108 MHz of spectrum: the upper end of the UHF band, or TV channels 52 to 69.

Osmosis is the diffusion of water through a cell wall or membrane or any partially-permeable
barrier from a solution of low solute concentration (high water potential) to a solution
with high solute concentration (low water potential), up a solute concentration gradient.
It is a physical process in which a solvent moves, without input of energy, across a
semi-permeable membrane (permeable to the solvent, but not the solute) separating
two solutions of different concentrations.
---
osmosis is the movement of a solvent (in this case water) across semi-permeable membranes (like cell
walls), from areas of lower solute concentration to areas of higher solute concentration.

A continental divide is a line of elevated terrain which forms a border
 between two watersheds such that water falling on one side of the line
 eventually travels to one ocean or body of water, and water on the other
 side travels to another, generally on the opposite side of the continent.

A drainage basin is an extent of land where water from rain or snow melt drains
 downhill into a body of water, such as a river, lake, reservoir, estuary, wetland,
sea or ocean. The drainage basin includes both the streams and rivers that convey
 the water as well as the land surfaces from which water drains into those channels,
 and is separated from adjacent basins by a drainage divide.
The drainage basin acts like a funnel, collecting all the water within the
 area covered by the basin and channelling it into a waterway. Each drainage
 basin is separated topographically from adjacent basins by a geographical
barrier such as a ridge, hill or mountain, which is known as a water divide.
Other terms that are used to describe the a drainage basin are catchment,
catchment area, catchment basin, drainage area, river basin water basin and watershed.
In the technical sense, a watershed refers to a divide that separates one drainage
area from another drainage area.[3] However, in the United States and Canada, the
term is often used to mean a drainage basin or catchment area itself.

high altitude:
At high altitude, atmospheric pressure is lower compared to sea level. This
is due to two competing physical effects: gravity, which causes the air to be
 as close as possible to the ground; and the heat content of the air, which
causes the molecules to bounce off each other and expand.
Because of the lower pressure, the air expands as it rises, which causes it to cool.
Thus, high altitude air is cold,

sinecure: A position or office that requires little or no work but provides a salary.

meme:
A unit of cultural information, such as a cultural practice or idea, that is
transmitted verbally or by repeated action from one mind to another.
++++
consists of any idea or behavior that can pass from one person to another by
learning or imitation. Examples include thoughts, ideas, theories, gestures,
 practices, fashions, habits, songs, and dances. Memes propagate themselves
and can move through the cultural sociosphere in a manner similar to the contagious behavior of a virus.
++++
Richard Dawkins coined the word "meme" as a neologism in his book
The Selfish Gene (1976) to describe how one might extend evolutionary principles
 to explain the spread of ideas and cultural phenomena. He gave as examples
 melodies, catch-phrases, beliefs (notably religious belief, clothing/fashion,
and the technology of building arches)

State of matter
A state of matter (or physical state, or form of matter) has physical properties
 which are qualitatively different from other states of matter.
Traditionally three states of matter were recognized : solid which maintains
 a fixed volume and shape, liquid maintains a fixed volume but adopts the shape
 of its container, and gas which occupies the entire volume available.
+++++++
a solid to a liquid = melting (heat energy added) e.g. ice melts to water
a liquid to a gas = evaporation (heat energy added) e.g. water to water vapour
a solid to a gas = sublimation (heat energy added) e.g. dried ice (frozen CO2) to carbon dioxide
a gas to a liquid = condensation (heat energy removed) e.g. cloud to rain
a liquid to a solid = freezing (heat energy removed) e.g. water to ice
a gas to a solid = deposition (heat energy removed) e.g. water vapour to frost
++++
plasma: An electrically neutral, highly ionized gas composed of ions, electrons, and neutral particles.
 It is a phase of matter distinct from solids, liquids, and normal gases.
+++
Plasma is the fourth state of matter. It is hotter than a gas. A plasma occurs when the
temperature is between 1000 degrees C and 1,000,000,000 degrees C. Some examples of
 plasma are the charged air around lightning and stars, including our own sun.
As a gas is heated, electrons begin to leave the atoms, resulting in the presence of
free electrons, which are not bound to an atom or molecule, and ions, which are chemical
species that contain unequal number of electrons and protons, and therefore possess an
electrical charge. The free electric charges make the plasma electrically conductive so
 that it responds strongly to electromagnetic fields. At very high temperatures,
 such as those present in stars, it is assumed that essentially all electrons
 are "free," and that a very high-energy plasma is essentially bare nuclei swimming
in a sea of electrons. Plasma is believed to be the most common state of matter in the universe.
+++
plasma is an ionized gas, in which a certain proportion of electrons are free
rather than being bound to an atom or molecule. The ability of the positive and negative
 charges to move somewhat independently makes the plasma electrically conductive so
that it responds strongly to electromagnetic fields. Plasma therefore has properties
 quite unlike those of solids, liquids or gases and is considered to be a distinct
 state of matter. Plasma typically takes the form of neutral gas-like clouds (e.g. stars).
 The explanation of the example, star, is a massive, luminous ball of plasma.

Disabuse me of my ignorance

contrail:
condensation trail left behind jet aircrafts.
Contrails form when hot humid air from jet exhaust mixes with environmental air of
low vapor pressure and low temperature. The mixing is a result of turbulence generated
by the engine exhaust. Cloud formation by a mixing process is similar to the cloud you
 see when you exhale and "see your breath".
+++
How long a contrail remains intact, depends on the humidity structure and winds
of the upper troposphere. If the atmosphere is near saturation, the contrail may
 exist for sometime. On the other hand, if the atmosphere is dry then as the contrail
 mixes with the environment it dissipates.
+++
Jet fuel is made of carbon and hydrogen.
When jet fuel burns with oxygen, most of the exhaust consists of CO2 (carbon dioxide)
and H2O (water). The water is generally an invisible vapor.
+++
When you exhale, your breath contains a great deal of invisible water vapor as well.
You may have noticed that on certain days in the winter, your breath will form a cloud
of condensation when you exhale. In the summer, however, you don't see your breath.
Cold air can hold a lot less moisture than warm air, so in the winter, when the
moisture in your breath hits the cold air, the moisture condenses into a visible cloud.
+++
The same thing happens when a jet engine "exhales." If the temperature, winds and humidity
 in the upper atmosphere are right, long, white contrails form when the moisture in
 the exhaust condenses.
+++++++
The main products of hydrocarbon fuel combustion are carbon dioxide and water vapor.
At high altitudes this water vapor emerges into a cold environment, and the local
increase in water vapor can push the water content of the air past saturation point.
 The vapor then condenses into tiny water droplets and/or deposits into ice. These
 millions of tiny water droplets and/or ice crystals form the vapour trail or
contrails. The energy drop (and therefore, time and distance) the vapor needs
to condense accounts for the contrail forming some way behind the aircraft's engines.
++
Exhaust vapour trails or contrails usually occur above 8000 metres (26,000 feet). where
the temperature is below -40C.
++++++++++++++++++
Contrails are clouds formed when water vapor condenses and freezes around small
particles (aerosols) that exist in aircraft exhaust. Some of that water vapor comes
 from the air around the plane; and, some is added by the exhaust of the aircraft.

cloud:
Clouds form when relatively warm air containing water vapor is lighter than its
surrounding air and this causes it to rise. As it rises it cools and the vapor
condenses out of the air as micro-droplets. These tiny particles of water are
 relatively densely packed and sunlight cannot penetrate far into the cloud before
 it is reflected out, giving a cloud its characteristic white color. As a cloud
 matures, the droplets may combine to produce larger droplets, which may combine
to form droplets large enough to fall as rain.

absolute humidity:
is the mass of water vapor divided by the mass of dry air in a volume of air at a
given temperature. The hotter the air is, the more water it can contain.
++
relative humidity:
is the ratio of the current absolute humidity to the highest possible absolute humidity
(which depends on the current air temperature).
A reading of 100 percent relative humidity means that the air is totally saturated with
 water vapor and cannot hold any more, creating the possibility of rain. This doesn't
mean that the relative humidity must be 100 percent in order for it to rain -- it
must be 100 percent where the clouds are forming, but the relative humidity near
 the ground could be much less.
If the air is at 100-percent relative humidity, sweat will not evaporate into the
air. As a result, we feel much hotter than the actual temperature when the relative humidity is high.

Psychological Projection:
In psychology, psychological projection (or projection bias) is a defense mechanism in which
one attributes one's own unacceptable or unwanted thoughts or/and emotions to others.
Projection reduces anxiety by allowing the expression of the unwanted subconscious
impulses/desires without letting the conscious mind recognize them. The theory
was developed by Sigmund Freud and further refined by his daughter Anna Freud,
+++
According to Sigmund Freud, projection is a psychological defense mechanism whereby
one "projects" one's own undesirable thoughts, motivations, desires, and feelings onto someone else.

confirmation bias is a tendency to search for or interpret new information in a way
that confirms one's preconceptions and avoids information and interpretations which

e.g. Their team came out onto the field, loaded for bear, but our defense stopped them.

third-party check:
Say Jack has a cheque from Bob, and Jack wants to pay walmart with that cheque...that would be
 a 3rd party check. Essentially it would be a cheque you are using (with the permission of
who ever owns the cheque) to pay someone, so the owner of the cheque would be the 3rd party
 since they are outside of the acutal transaction betwen you and who ever you are paying.
 Hardly anywhere will accept a third party check because of the high risk of fraud.
+++++
If somebody gives you a check, and you turn it over and write "pay to the order of ____" in
order to give it to a third party, that makes it a third party check. An example would be

travel tickets, hotel reservations, meeting information, birthday reminders, coupons, claim tickets,
call-back notes, follow-up reminders, maintenance reminders, or any other papers that require
future action. Each day, the folder having the current date is retrieved from the tickler file
so that any documents within it may be acted on. Essentially, a tickler file provides a way
 to send a reminder to oneself in the future: "tickling" one's memory.

---
VPN: allow you to create secure connections to other networks over the internet
==
When you connect your computer to a VPN, the computer acts as if it’s on the same local network as
the VPN. All your network traffic is sent over a secure connection to the VPN. Because your computer
behaves as if it’s on the network, this allows you to securely access local network resources even
when you’re on the other side of the world. You’ll also be able to use the Internet as if you were
present at the VPN’s location, which has some benefits if you’re using pubic Wi-Fi or want to access
geo-blocked websites.
---
VPN is used to create a secure, encrypted connection between your computer and a server operated by
the VPN service. In a professional setting, this tunnel makes you part of the company's network, as
if you were physically sitting in the office.

leased line
A leased line connects two locations for private voice and/or data telecommunication service.
Not a dedicated cable, a leased line is actually a reserved circuit between two points. Leased
lines can span short or long distances. They maintain a single open circuit at all times,
as opposed to traditional telephone services that reuse the same lines for many different
conversations through a process called "switching."
+++
Leased lines most commonly are rented by businesses to connect branch offices, because these
lines guarantee bandwidth for network traffic. So-called T1 leased lines are common and
offer the same data rate as symmetric DSL (1.544 Mbps).

intranet
Intranet is the generic term for a collection of private computer networks within an organization.

extranet
An extranet is a computer network that allows controlled access from the outside for specific
business or educational purposes. Extranets are extensions to, or segments of, private intranet
networks that have been built in many corporations for information sharing and ecommerce.

deduction vs induction
The logical processes known as deduction and induction work in opposite ways. In deduction general
 principles are applied to specific instances. Thus, using a mathematical formula to figure the
 volume of air that can be contained in a gymnasium is applying deduction. Similarly, applying
a law of physics to predict the outcome of an experiment is reasoning by deduction. By contrast,
induction makes generalizations based on a number of specific instances. The observation of hundreds
of examples in which a certain chemical kills plants might prompt the inductive conclusion that the
 chemical is toxic to all plants. Inductive generalizations are often revised as more examples are
 studied and more facts are known. If certain plants that have not been tested turn out to be
unaffected by the chemical, the conclusion about the chemical's toxicity must be revised or
 restricted. In this way, an inductive generalization is much like a hypothesis.

90th percentile

heuristic
is an adjective for experience-based techniques that help in problem solving, learning and discovery.
A heuristic method is particularly used to rapidly come to a solution that is hoped to be close to
the best possible answer, or 'optimal solution'. Heuristics are "rules of thumb", educated guesses,
 intuitive judgments or simply common sense.

heuristics:
an experience-based approach to problem solving
++
pertains to the process of gaining knowledge or some desired result by intelligent guesswork rather than
by following some preestablished formula. (Heuristic can be contrasted with algorithm ic.)
The term seems to have two usages:
1) Describing an approach to learning by trying without necessarily having an organized hypothesis
 or way of proving that the results proved or disproved the hypothesis. That is, "seat-of-the-pants"
 or "trial-by-error" learning.
2) Pertaining to the use of the general knowledge gained by experience, sometimes expressed as
"using a rule-of-thumb." (However, heuristic knowledge can be applied to complex as well as simple
 everyday problems. Human chess players use a heuristic

braise, broil, grill, roast
When you cook meat on a pre-heated, dry pan without oil it is called pan-grilling.
 Broiling and grilling are the same: cooking food directly under or over a heat source in the oven
under the broiling element or on the grill.  Braising is to brown food in oil first, then cover
and cook in a small amount of liquid at a low temperature for a long time either on top of the
stove or in the oven.  Roasting is to cook a food in an open pan in the oven with no added liquid.

java.util.List interface is a subtype of the java.util.Collection interface.

list implementation: ArrayList, LinkedList, Vector, Stack

java.util.Set interface

set implemention: EnumSet, HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet
HashSet is backed by a HashMap. It makes no guarantees about the sequence of the elements when you iterate them
LinkedHashSet differs from HashSet by guaranteeing that the order of the elements during iteration is
the same as the order they were inserted into the LinkedHashSet. Reinserting an element that is already in
the LinkedHashSet does not change this order.
TreeSet also guarantees the order of the elements when iterated, but the order is the sorting order of the elements.

diff btw HashSet and Set: Hashset allows null

java.util.SortedSet interface is a subtype of the java.util.Set. actual implementation: java.util.TreeSet

The order of the sorting is either the natural sorting order of the elements (if they implement
java.lang.Comparable), or the order determined by a Comparator that you can give to the SortedSet

java.util.Map interface: a dictionary
	implementation: HashMap, HashTable, EnumMap, IdentityHashMap, LinkedHashMap,
	Properties, TreeMap, WeakHashMap
	note: key must be an object, no primitive type
	Note: Properties is a subclass of HashTable, each key and value is a string
	Hashtable is one of the original collection classes in Java. HashMap is
	 part of the new Collections Framework, added with Java 2, v1.2.
	Hashtable is synchronized, HashMap is not.
	HashMap permits null values in it, while Hashtable doesn't. conclusion: use HashMap
==
Fail-fast: Fail asap by making checks aggressively. HashMap's iterator is fail-fast because it
throws a ConcurrentModificationException as soon as it detects change in underlying structure.

Properties: a subclass of HashTable: Properties.load(inputStream): load properties file
properties.keySet() : return a set of keys
properties.values() : return a collection of values
properties.entrySet() : return a collection of Map.Entry, which a key-value pair (like Association in Smalltalk)

HashMap: no sequencing
TreeMap: order (iteration order is the sort order of keys/values)

// key iterator
Iterator iterator = mapA.keySet().iterator();

// value iterator
Iterator iterator = mapA.values();

Iterator iterator = mapA.keySet().iterator();
while(iterator.hasNext(){
  Object key   = iterator.next();
  Object value = mapA.get(key);
}

//access via new for-loop
for(Object key : mapA.keySet()) {
    Object value = mapA.get(key);
}

NavigableMap and Navigableset

java.util.Queue interface (inserted at the end of the queue, and elements removed from the beginning of the queue)
	implementation: LinkedList, PriorityQueue

java.util.Deque  (a queue where you can insert and remove elements from both ends of the queue) Double Ended Queue"
	ArrayDeque, LinkedList

implement hashCode() and equals()

sorting: sort List collections using the java.util.Collections.sort()
	can sort List and LinkedList
++
List list = new ArrayList();

//add elements to the list

Collections.sort(list);

For objects to have a natural order they must implement the interface java.lang.Comparable

public interface Comparable<T> {
  int compareTo(T o);
}

 The compareTo() method should compare this object to another object, return an int value. Here are the rules for that int value:

    * Return a negative value if this object is smaller than the other object
    * Return 0 (zero) if this object is equal to the other object.
    * Return a positive value if this object is larger than the other object

Comparator (non-natural order)
List list = new ArrayList();

//add elements to the list

Comparator comparator = new SomeComparator();

Collections.sort(list, comparator);

or implements the Comparator interface
	2 methods: compare(), equals()

synchronization wrapper: Map m = Collections.synchronizedMap(new HashMap(...));
The iterators returned by all of this class's "collection view methods" are fail-fast: if the
map is structurally modified at any time after the iterator is created, in any way except
through the iterator's own remove or add methods, the iterator will throw a ConcurrentModificationException.

Enumeration is legacy, not in the new Collection framework
	contains 2 methods namely hasMoreElements() & nextElement().
Iterator is new , in the collection framework
	three methods namely hasNext(), next(),remove().
diff: Iterator: can remove elements during iteration

Cloneable interface:
A class implements the Cloneable interface to indicate to the Object.clone() method that it
is legal for that method to make a field-for-field copy of instances of that class.
Invoking Object's clone method on an instance that does not implement the Cloneable interface
 results in the exception CloneNotSupportedException being thrown.
By convention, classes that implement this interface should override Object.clone (which is protected)
 with a public method. See Object.clone() for details on overriding this method.

ByteArrayInputStream: read data from byte arrays as streams
DataInputStream: enables you to read Java primitives from InputStream's instead of only bytes
PrintStream: enables you to write formatted data to an underlying OutputStream.
PrintWriter: enables you to write formatted data to an underlying Writer
StringWriter: enables you to obtain the characters written to a Writer  as a String: uses StringBuffer
So StringWriter is basically an Adapter that adapts a StringBuffer to the Writer interface.

stream: continuous flow of data you can read from or write to. no concept of index.

exception wrapping
wrapping is when you catch an exception, wrap it in a different exception and throw that exception.
to prevent the code further up the call stack from having to know about every possible exception in the system.
--> do not want to end up with top level methods that declare many different exceptions.
--> you may not want your top level components to know anything about the bottom level components,
++
Exception wrapping may result in very long stack traces consisting of one stack trace for each exception
in the wrapping hierarchy.
The messages of the exceptions are spread out over the stack traces.

another approach: exception enrichment : add additional info to an exception

ISO image
An ISO image is an archive file (also known as a disc image) of an optical disc in a format defined by
the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). This format is supported by many software vendors.
 ISO image files typically have a file extension of .iso. The name ISO is taken from the ISO 9660 file
system used with CD-ROM media, but an ISO image can also contain a UDF file system since UDF
 is backward-compatible with ISO 9660.
+++
In the context of files and programs, an "image", whether an ISO, floppy, or other media image,
 is simply a file that can be used as a virtually identical copy of the original media. This file not
only contains individual data files; it also contains track and sector information and arranges all
this information in a file system, just like disk media. Image files, unlike normal files, are
usually not opened; rather, they are mounted.
An ISO image is simply a CD-ROM or DVD image saved in ISO-9660 format.
++
ISO images are mainly used as source files from which to create media.
After you download the image, you can use CD-burning software to recreate the physical CD-ROM/DVD install media.

OSGi
OSGi (Open Services Gateway Initiative) is an industry plan for a standard way to connect devices
 such as home appliances and security systems to the Internet. With such a standard, home users
 could, for example, install a security system and be able to change from one monitoring service
to another without having to install a new system of wires and devices. The "service gateway"
would be an application server in a computer that was a gateway between the Internet and a home
 or small business's network of device. The OSGi plans to specify the application program interface (API)
for programmers to use to allow communication and control between service providers and the devices
 within the home or small business network. OSGi's API will be built on the Java programming language.

OSGi technology is the dynamic module system for Java

An OSGi Framework is an open, modular and sizeable "Service Delivery Plattform".

OSGi emerged out of work to connect home appliances and security systems to the Internet.
It has since evolved into a more generic SOA componentized model for connecting a variety of services.
initially: a set of standards for a Java-based service framework that could be remotely managed.

public-key cryptography
1. To send me an encrypted message, you use my public key to encrypt the message.
2. then I use my private key to decrypt the message

digital signature
1. I have a message/document to send
2. apply a hashing function to the document to create a message digest (aka hash, checksum)
3. to create a digital signature, I sign(encrypt) the message digest with my private key
4. I then send the document and the digital signature (encrypted message digest)
recipient to authenticate:
1. apply the same hashing function to the document.
2. decrypt the encrypted message digest (digital signature) using my public key.
3. compare the output of 1 against the output of 2
If not equal -> (1) someone is impersonating me (2) the document has been altered
(3) error during transmission

A hash function H is a transformation that takes an input m and returns a fixed-size string,
which is called the hash value h  (that is, h = H(m)).
A hash function H is said to be one-way if it is hard to invert
The hash value represents concisely the longer message or document from which it was computed;
 this value is called the message digest. One can think of a message digest as
 a "digital fingerprint" of the larger document.

servlet/JSP and EJB
ervlets/JSPs and EJB are complementary, not competing technologies: Servlets provide support for writing web based applications whereas EJBs provide support for writing transactional objects.
JSP or XML/XSL technologies provide support for the front end (UI, client) code, where EJB provides
 support for the back end (database connection pooling, declaritive transactions, declaritive security, standardized parameterization...)

 EJB model mandates  a separation between display and business logic.

Some of the hings that servlets and JSPs can do that EJBs cannot are:

    * Respond to http/https protocol requests.
    * (With JSP) provide an easy way to format HTML output.
    * Easily associate a web user with session information

Some of the things that EJBs enable you to do that servlets/JSPs do not are:

    * Declaritively manage transactions. In EJB, you merely specify whether a bean's methods require,
	disallow, or can be used in the context of a transaction. The EJB container will manage your
	transaction boundaries appropriately. In a purely servlet architecture, you'll have to write code
	 to manage the transaction, which is difficult if a logical transaction must access multiple datasources.
    * Declaritively manage security. The EJB model allows you to indicate a security role that
	the user must be assigned to in order to invoke a method on a bean. In Servlets/JSPs you must
	 write code to do this. Note, however that the security model in EJB is sufficient for
	only 90% to 95% of application code - there are always security scenarios that require reference
	 to values of an entity, etc.

EJB provides:
resource management, transaction management, security, scalability, threading issues, pooling,

Granularity is the extent to which a system is broken down into small parts
It is the extent to which a larger entity is subdivided.
For example, a yard broken into inches has finer granularity than a yard broken into feet

Coarse-grained systems consist of fewer, larger components than fine-grained  systems;
a coarse-grained description of a system regards large subcomponents while a fine-grained
description regards smaller components of which the larger ones are composed.
The granularity of data refers to the fineness with which data fields are sub-divided.
For example, a postal address can be recorded, with low granularity, as a single field:
or with high granularity, as multiple fields:
Higher granularity has overheads for data input and storage.

TV (interlacing)
interlace is a technique of improving the picture quality of a video signal without consuming extra bandwidth.
TV and video pictures are made up of a number of images (frames) that are sequentially displayed
 on your screen to give the illusion of movement. The rate at which the frames are displayed
is fixed at 25 frames-per second (fps) in the PAL system, and 30 fps in the NTSC system.
In order to send these pictures over the air, or along a cable, each frame is split up into a number of horizontal strips (lines),
Each line is transmitted separately to your TV tube where they are 'painted' (scanned) in sequence on the viewing screen, to recreate the original frame images.
Each frame is divided into two parts (fields) by taking even numbered lines as one field, and odd
numbered lines as the other. These two fields are then transmitted in sequence (odd, then even),
instead of the original frame. The rate at which these fields are produced on our TV tube is now twice the frame rate, which reduces the perceptible flicker substantially.
The reason why 50 fields/sec (60 NTSC) is used is to minimise the visual disturbance caused by mains-power interference which would show as a wobble in the picture.
The PAL system comprises 625 lines, of which 574 are active. NTSC has 525 lines, of which 485 are active.
NTSC: 60 fields every second, resulting in 30 frames per second

This execution plan is basically a step by step instruction for how the statement must be executed. That is,
 the order in which tables are read, if indexes are used, which join methods are used to join tables and so on.

tunneling
when one network protocol (the delivery protocol) encapsulates a different payload protocol.
provide a secure path through an untrusted network.
+++
also known as "port forwarding," is the transmission of data intended for use only within a private,
usually corporate network through a public network in such a way that the routing nodes in the public
network are unaware that the transmission is part of a private network. Tunneling is generally done by
 encapsulating the private network data and protocol information within the public network transmission
units so that the private network protocol information appears to the public network as data. Tunneling
allows the use of the Internet, which is a public network, to convey data on behalf of a private network.

message semantics:
synchronous/asynchronous, request/reply, transactional, publish/subscribe and guaranteed delivery.
 The choice of protocol should depend on messaging requirements, for example a common requirement
is point-to-point versus one-to-many, which drives the request/reply or publish/subscribe decision.
 Another example would be a fast message producer paired with a slow message consumer, which is easily
 implemented with a message queue.

business intelligence
(BI) systems take vast quantities of data and put it into visually useful forms (such as graphs and charts)
for sophisticated analysis of business trends.

WPF:
is a graphical subsystem for rendering user interfaces in Windows-based applications.
WPF, previously known as "Avalon", was initially released as part of .NET Framework 3.0.
 Rather than relying on the older GDI subsystem, WPF utilizes DirectX. WPF attempts to provide
a consistent programming model for building applications and provides a clear separation between the user interface and the business logic.
WPF employs XAML, a derivative of XML, to define and link various UI elements

Windows Forms
is the name given to the graphical application programming interface (API) included as a
part of Microsoft's .NET Framework, providing access to the native Microsoft Windows interface

domain-driven design
an approach to developing software for complex needs by deeply connecting the implementation to an evolving model of the core business concepts.
The premise of domain-driven design is the following:

    * Placing the project's primary focus on the core domain and domain logic
    * Basing complex designs on a model
    * Initiating a creative collaboration between technical and domain experts to iteratively cut ever closer to the conceptual heart of the problem.
premise of DDD:
    * For most software projects, the primary focus should be on the domain and domain logic; and
    * Complex domain designs should be based on a model.
+++++
Entity: An object that is not defined by its attributes, but rather by a thread of continuity and its identity.
Value Object: An object that contains attributes but has no conceptual identity. They should be treated as immutable.
Aggregate: A collection of objects that are bound together by a root entity, otherwise known as an aggregate root.
++++++
we want to build a domain model that captures the problem domain of the system being built, and we are going to express that understanding in code / software artifacts.

mixin
a class that provides a certain functionality to be inherited by a subclass, while not meant for
instantiation  (the generation of objects of that class). Inheriting from a mixin is not a form of
 specialization but is rather a means of collecting functionality.
++ A mixin can also be viewed as an interface with implemented methods.
--> an interface with an implementation
--best--> a mechanism that allows you to add methods to a class without using inheritance.

Action-based (aka Push-based MVC) frameworks: model pushes data to view
	eg. Struts, Django, Ruby on Rails and Spring MVC
Component-based (aka Pull-based MVC) frameworks: view pulls data from model/controller
	eg. Struts2, Lift, Tapestry, JBoss Seam, Wicket and Stripes

inversion of control (dependency injection)
in the Java EE world, there is the mechanism called the Java Naming and Directory Interfaces (JNDI)
used to look up internal or external services.
These could be an enterprise JavaBean, a database, or a message queue. Instead of the developer doing
all those extra steps to look up internal or external services, the framework does the work and hands
 to the component or object a reference to that external service. In other words, the service look-up
responsibility is delegated to the framework.

OOP: a paradigm where real world problems are decomposed into objects that abstract behavior
and data in a single unit.

AOP is a new technology for separating crosscutting concerns into single units called aspects.
==
An aspect is a common feature that's typically scattered across methods, classes, object
hierarchies, or even entire object models. It is behavior that looks and smells like it should have
structure, but you can't find a way to express this structure in code with traditional
object-oriented techniques.

join point: an execution point in a program
point cut: specifies criteria that match join points. a way to specify join points
  an expression that determines whether an advice should be executed.
advice: a means to specify code to be run at join points
  action that should be taken at join points.
--> let you add behavior to your POJO without modifying your code
---
AOP: a technique that enables adding executable blocks to your source code without changing it.
--> allow you to add behavior to your source code without changing it.
---
1. Aspect: An aspect is a class that implements enterprise application concerns that cut across multiple classes, such as transaction management. Aspects can be a normal class configured through Spring XML configuration or we can use Spring AspectJ integration to define a class as Aspect using @Aspect annotation.
2. Join Point: A join point is the specific point in the application such as method execution, exception handling, changing object variable values etc. In Spring AOP a join points is always the execution of a method.
3. Advice: Advices are actions taken for a particular join point. In terms of programming, they are methods that gets executed when a certain join point with matching pointcut is reached in the application. You can think of Advices as Struts2 interceptors or Servlet Filters.
 --> define the what and when of an aspect
4. Pointcut: Pointcut are expressions that is matched with join points to determine whether advice needs to be executed or not. Pointcut uses different kinds of expressions that are matched with the join points and Spring framework uses the AspectJ pointcut expression language.Target Object: They are the object on which advices are applied. Spring AOP is implemented using runtime proxies so this object is always a proxied object. What is means is that a subclass is created at runtime where the target method is overridden and advices are included based on their configuration.
  --> define the where.
5. AOP proxy: Spring AOP implementation uses JDK dynamic proxy to create the Proxy classes with target classes and advice invocations, these are called AOP proxy classes. We can also use CGLIB proxy by adding it as the dependency in the Spring AOP project.
6. Weaving: It is the process of linking aspects with other objects to create the advised proxy objects. This can be done at compile time, load time or at runtime. Spring AOP performs weaving at the runtime.
 --> weaving: the process of applying aspects to a target object to create a new proxied object.
-- The key unit of modularity in OOP is the class, whereas in AOP the unit of modularity is the aspect.
-- aspects help to modularize cross-cutting concerns.
-- cross-cutting concern: any functionality that affects multiple points of a system.
-- AOP: an alternative to Inheritance and delegation.

Scaffolding is a meta-programming method of building database-backed software applications. It
is a technique supported by some model-view-controller frameworks, in which the programmer may
 write a specification that describes how the application database may be used. The compiler
uses this specification to generate code that the application can use to create, read, update
and delete database entries, effectively treating the template as a "scaffold" on which to build
a more powerful application.
--> Scafolding is usually some type of code generation where you point it at a database, and the technology creates basic CRUD (create, read, update, delete) screens.
--
scaffolding generally refers to quickly seting up a skeleton for an app.

Metaprogramming is the writing of computer programs that write or manipulate other programs
(or themselves) as their data, or that do part of the work at compile time that would otherwise
 be done at runtime.

active record pattern: used in ORM tools
an approach to accessing data in a database. A database table or view is wrapped into a class.
 Thus, an object  instance is tied to a single row in the table. After creation of an object,
 a new row is added to the table upon save. Any object loaded gets its information from the
database. When an object is updated the corresponding row in the table is also updated. The
wrapper class implements accessor methods or properties for each column in the table or view.

continuous query
traditional query: the query result is static, represents a snapshot of db in the past.
continuous query: the query result is dynamic, updated constantly in real-time.
++ is ideal for situations in which an application repeats a particular query, and would benefit
 from always having instant access to the up-to-date result of that query.
--> a Coherence Continuous Query is a cached query result that never gets out-of-date.

oracle optimizer hints
all_rows: explicitly chooses the cost-based approach to optimize a statement block with a goal of best throughput (that is, minimum total resource consumption).
designed to minimize overall machine resources and disk I/O.
tends to favor full table scans, and is generally used in large data warehouses where immediate response time is not required.
the downside to this optimization technique that no rows from the query will be available until the entire query has been completed.
e.g. SELECT /*+ ALL_ROWS */ empno, ename, sal, job FROM emp WHERE empno = 7566;

first_rows: instruct Oracle to optimize an individual SQL statement for fast response.
 goal is to begin to return rows to the query as quickly as possible, even if it means extra disk I/O.
use index. has the downside of causing additional I/O within the database as the index nodes are accessed.
e.g. SELECT /*+ FIRST_ROWS(10) */ empno, ename, sal, job FROM emp WHERE deptno = 20;

Read-consistent queries: Queries that produce consistent results with respect to a
point in time.

read consistency (oracle)

Statement-Level Read Consistency:
all the data returned by a single query comes from a single point in time when the query began. Therefore, a query never sees 'dirty' data nor any of the changes made by transactions that commit during query execution.
-- > Guarantees that the set of data seen by a statement is consistent with respect to a single point in time and does not change during statement execution

Transaction-Level Read Consistency:
the data returned by all the queries comes from a single point in time

By default, Oracle guarantees statement-level read consistency. The set of data returned by
 a single query is consistent with respect to a single point in time. However, in some situations,
 you might also require transaction-level read consistency. This is the ability to run multiple
queries within a single transaction, all of which are read-consistent with respect to the
same point in time, so that queries in this transaction do not see the effects of
intervening committed transactions. If you want to run a number of queries against multiple tables
 and if you are not doing any updating, you prefer a read-only transaction.

strategy pattern:
where algorithms are represented as interchangeable objects

software architectural style
generally refers to "a set of design rules that identify the kinds of components and connectors that may
be used to compose a system or subsystem.

Let's cross that bridge when we come to it: a way of telling someone not to worry about something that has not happened yet.

aggregate:
A collection of objects that are bound together by a root entity, otherwise known as an aggregate root.
 The aggregrate root guarantees the consistency of changes being made within the aggregate by forbidding external objects from holding references to its members.
An aggregate also defines the boundary for concurrency control
a unit of business entity

++++++ From DDD +++++++++

    * Services: When an operation does not conceptually belong to any object. Following the natural contours of the problem, you can implement these operations in services. The Service concept is called "Pure Fabrication" in GRASP.

    * Repositories: methods for retrieving domain objects should delegate to a specialized Repository object such that alternative storage implementations may be easily interchanged.

    * Factories: methods for creating domain objects should delegate to a specialized Factory object such that alternative implementations may be easily interchanged.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Multiversion concurrency control (abbreviated MCC or MVCC),
in the database field of computer science, is a concurrency control method commonly used by database management
systems to provide concurrent access to the database and in programming languages to implement transactional memory.
For instance, a database will implement updates not by deleting an old piece of data and overwriting it with
a new one, but instead by marking the old data as obsolete and adding the newer "version."

Test-driven development
is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle:
first the developer writes a failing automated test case that defines a desired improvement or new function,
then produces code to pass that test and finally refactors the new code to acceptable standards.
++++
Test-driven development requires developers to create automated unit tests that define code requirements
(immediately) before writing the code itself. The tests contain assertions that are either true or false.
Passing the tests confirms correct behavior as developers evolve and refactor the code. Developers often
use testing frameworks, such as xUnit, to create and automatically run sets of test cases.

DMZ, or demilitarized zone is a physical or logical subnetwork that contains and exposes an
 organization's external services to a larger untrusted network, usually the Internet.
The purpose of a DMZ is to add an additional layer of security to an organization's local area network (LAN);
 an external attacker only has access to equipment in the DMZ, rather than any other part of the network.

OWSM has two ways of enforcing (or applying) security etc. for a Web Service. Oracle calls
these Policy Enforcement Points (PEPs). The two types of PEPs are called Gateways and Agents.
+++
Gateways
Runs in the OAS and acts as an proxy for all incoming requests. The Gateway inspects the request and
allows or disallows it to pass-through to the Web Service.
    * Content routing so which Web Service that is called is based on the content in the message request.
    * Do not guarantee endpoint-level security, meaning that the communication between a Gateway and a Web Service is not encrypted.
+++
Agents : security inside containers
An Agent can either run server side with the actual Web Service or client side with the Web Service client.
 It can be configured to communicate with the OWSM Policy Manager. If it is, it retrieves its security
information (the policies to enforce/apply) from the Policy Manager. If the the Policy Manager is disabled,
 then the Agent will look for a local file that contains the most recently retrieved set of security
 policies to be enforced/applied.
---------------
A client-side Agent would typically be used if the client does not support the security protocols
needed to consume Web Services -- e.g., encrypting the requests it sends (or portions of the requests),
 validating signatures on the responses it gets in return, etc. A server-side Agent would typically
 be used to guarantee endpoint-level security by, for instance, requiring requests it receives to
be digitally signed, encrypting the responses (or portions of the responses) being returned, etc.
 These are just examples of a couple of security features that the OWSM Agents support, and is not
 by any means an exhaustive list.
---------------
Gateways are easier to implement than Agents.

MVC
The model is not a database: the 'model' in MVC is both the data and the business/domain logic needed to manipulate the data in the application.
he view renders the model into a form suitable for interaction
A controller accepts input from the user and instructs the model and viewport to perform actions based on that input.
User uses controller to manipulate model, which updates the view.
Model manages the data and business logic. view renders the user interface. controller receives user input
and instruct the model and view to perform certain actions

General average
The law of general average is a legal principle of maritime law according to which all parties
in a sea venture proportionally share any losses resulting from a voluntary sacrifice of part of the ship or cargo to save the whole in an emergency.
In the exigencies of hazards faced at sea, crew members often have precious little time in which
to determine precisely whose cargo they are jettisoning. Thus, to avoid quarrelling that could
waste valuable time, there arose the equitable practice whereby all the merchants whose cargo
landed safely would be called on to contribute a portion, based upon a share or percentage,
to the merchant or merchants whose goods had been tossed overboard to avert imminent peril.
 While general average traces its origins in ancient maritime law, still it remains part of
the admiralty law of most countries.

linked list (when to use it)
1 . you need constant-time insertions/deletions from the list (such as in real-time computing where time predictability is absolutely critical)
2. you don't know how many items will be in the list. With arrays, you may need to re-declare and copy memory if the array grows too big
3. you don't need random access to any elements
4. you want to be able to insert items in the middle of the list (such as a priority queue)
array vs linked list
Arrays have O(1) random access, but are really expensive to add stuff onto or remove stuff from.

method dispatch: the process of mapping a method call to a method implementation.
--> single dispatch: a method call is dispatched based on the type of the object on which
the method is called.
--> multiple dispatch: a method call is dispatched based on multiple pieces of info (typically

dynamic dispatch
is the process of mapping a message to a specific sequence of code (method) at runtime.
This is done to support the cases where the appropriate method cannot be determined at compile-time

 processes (such as for global variables) and the name is normally only used to describe a language
 feature where a runtime decision is required to determine which code to invoke.

A stalking horse is a person who tests a concept with someone or mounts a challenge against them on
behalf of an anonymous third party. If the idea proves viable and/or popular, the anonymous figure
 can then declare their interest and advance the concept with little risk of failure. If the concept

JPA:
an API for persisting java object in a relational db.
An entity is a lightweight persistence domain object. Typically an entity represents a table in a r
elational database, and each entity instance corresponds to a row in that table. The primary programming artifact of an entity is the entity class, although entities can use helper classes.
++
The persistent state of an entity is represented either through persistent fields or persistent properties.
These fields or properties use object/relational mapping annotations to map the entities and entity relationships to the relational data in the underlying data store.

Property of programming language
A property, in some object-oriented programming languages, is a special sort of class member,
intermediate between a field (or data member) and a method. Properties are read and written like fields,
 but property reads and writes are (usually) translated to get and set method calls. The field-like syntax
is said to be easier to read and write than lots of method calls, yet the interposition of method calls
allows for data validation, active updating (as of GUI visuals), and/or read-only 'fields'. That is,
 properties are intermediate between member code (methods) and member data (instance variables)
of the class, and properties provide a higher level of encapsulation than public fields.

A perspective determines the visible actions, views, and view layout

content-addressable storage: a file is retrieved based on its contents, not its storage location.
when you store a file, the system calculates a content address, which is later used to retrieve the file.

JPA merge
Usually merge() is used in the following scenario:

    the application loads an object in the first entity manager
    the object is passed up to the presentation layer
    some modifications are made to the object
    the object is passed back down to the business logic layer
    the application persists these modifications by calling merge() in a second entity manager

Here is the exact semantic of merge():

    if there is a managed instance with the same identifier currently associated with the persistence
 context, copy the state of the given object onto the managed instance
    if there is no managed instance currently associated with the persistence context, try to load it
 from the database, or create a new managed instance
    the managed instance is returned
    the given instance does not become associated with the persistence context, it remains detached and
is usually discarded

Persist takes an entity instance, adds it to the context and makes that instance managed
(ie future updates to the entity will be tracked)

Merge creates a new instance of your entity, copies the state from the supplied entity, and makes
 the new copy managed. The instance you pass in will not be managed (any changes you make will not
 be part of the transaction - unless you call merge again).

a continuation is an abstract representation of the control state of a computer program.
Continuations represent execution state that can be re-invoked

cascading: performing the same operation on a dependent object: persist, remove, refresh.
	should be used in dependent relationships only.
orphan removal: when a dependent object is removed from a relationship, it will be auto-deleted.

MapReduce
map: a function that divides work and distributes it to different nodes in a cluster.
Reduce: collates the work and merges the results into a single value
---
the result of the Map computation is a list of key-value pairs
Reduce then takes each set of values that has the same key and combines them into a single value.
----
Map: Do some data processing to every element of a collection (apply the same function to
every element of a collection)
Reduce: Iterate over the collection of data produced by the Map step and summarize the results.
---
MapReduce is a programming model for parallel processing. it works by breaking the processing
into two phases: the map phase and the reduce phase.
in the map phase, the input is divided into smaller chunks and processed.
in the reduce phase, the answers from the map phase are collected and merged into a single value.
---
map: data transformation
reduce: aggregation

MapReduce: a framework for processing parallelizable problems across large datasets using a large
number of computers (nodes), collectively referred to as a cluster (if all nodes are on the same
local network and use similar hardware) or a grid (if the nodes are shared across geographically and
administratively distributed systems, and use more heterogenous hardware). Processing can occur on
data stored either in a filesystem (unstructured) or in a database (structured). MapReduce can take
advantage of the locality of data, processing it near the place it is stored in order to minimize
communication overhead.

Hadoop: a framework for distributed processing

same-origin policy
JavaScript communications are restricted to the host serving the web page.
it means scripts loaded from one site cannot interact with scripts from other sites.
scripts loaded from one site can only communicate with that particular site.
XMLHTTPRequest object is allowed to communicate only with URLs within its own domain.
---
The same origin policy prevents a document or script loaded from one origin from getting or setting
properties of a document from another origin.
---
same origin policy says that the content loaded from one site is not allowed to interact
with the content loaded from other sites.
--
The same-origin policy is an important security concept implemented by web browsers to prevent
Javascript code from making requests against a different origin (e.g., different domain) than the
one from which it was served.
---
same origin policy: javascript code can only make request to the domain from which it is loaded.
enforced by the browser
---
to bypass same origin policy: CORS (cross-origin resource sharing)
the request is sent with an extra header called Origin.
If the server decides that the request should be allowed, it sends a Access-Control-Allow-Origin
header echoing back the same origin that was sent or * if it’s a public resource
If this header is missing, or the origins don’t match, then the browser disallows the request. If
all is well, then the browser processes the request.
---
same origin policy: the JS code running in a web page can only access data from the same
origin/domain.

federated network identity
A network identity scheme involving multiple repositories of identities instead of a
 central logical identity repository.
--> It means linking identity information stored across multiple identity management systems.
---
network identity
An identity that is recognized throughout a network, such as the Internet or an enterprise LAN
---
Networks, whether wireless or wired, may be loosely associated and coalesced into small groups
called federations
----
Federated networks are composed of several member networks that share some level of trust,
but member networks retain their own administrative control.
===
Federated identity allows users to link identity information between accounts without centrally
 storing personal information. This enables them to have a singular authentication without having
to logon with varying usernames and passwords.
===
SAML eliminates the need to maintain multiple authentication credentials in multiple locations?

DHTML is a TERM for making interactive web pages.
DHTML combines HTML, JavaScript, the HTML DOM, and CSS.
what is the DOM?
   --  a tree-based model for representing HTML and XML docs
   --  a language-indepedent API for accessing elements in HTML/XML docs
   --  a w3c standard
The HTML DOM is a standard for how to get, change, add, or delete HTML elements.
The contents of a web page are available to the JS program thru a mechanism called the DOM.
The DOM is an API by which languauges (such as JS) can access the contents of a web page.
====
when the browser renders a web page, it constructs a Document Object Model, a collection of
objects that represent the HTML elements on the page.
====
HTML contents are made available to script code via an object hierarchy called DOM.
====
to make interactive web pages, you need to manipulate the HTML document in the browser.
the language for doing this is JavaScript.
To manipulate the HTML document, you manipulate the DOM.
the Document Object Model is the way JavaScript sees the browser state and the HTML page it contains.
====
 AJAX is a way of exchanging data with a server, and updating parts of a web page - without reloading
 the whole page.
---
ajax is the concept of refreshing part of a HTML document without reloading the entire page.

In mathematics, two lines or curves are orthogonal if they are perpendicular at their point of intersection.
Two vectors are orthogonal if and only if their dot product is zero.
In computer science, orthogonality has to do with the ability of a language, method, or object to vary without
side-effects. When two statistics vary independently of each other, they are considered orthogonal.

testing concepts
===
Dummy objects are passed around but never actually used. Usually they are just used to fill parameter lists.
===
Fake objects actually have working implementations, but usually take some shortcut which makes them not suitable for production (an in memory database is a good example).
Fake objects act like the real object, but they go about it in a simpler way -- such as a DAO that uses a Map to store data instead of a real database.
===
Stubs provide canned answers to calls made during the test, usually not responding at all to anything outside what's programmed in for the test. Stubs may also record information about calls, such as an email gateway stub that remembers the messages it 'sent', or maybe only how many messages it 'sent'.
Stub objects provide a valid response, but it's static -- no matter what input you pass in, you'll always get the same response.
===
Mock objects are used in mock test cases -- they validate that certain methods are called on those objects.
Mocks are what we are talking about here: objects pre-programmed with expectations which form a
specification of the calls they are expected to receive.
Mocks are like stubs on steroids. They also know which methods to call and with what arguments.
 mock objects are simulated objects that mimic the behavior of real objects in controlled ways.
--> mock object: simulate the behavior of real objects upon which some code depends.
---
stubs enable state verification. you set expectations on mock objects (like which methods will be called)
mocks enable behavior verification
--> mock: you create expectations on which methods will be called on the mock objects
--> mock: represent a series of expectations

Recursion
===
solve a problem by solving smaller instances of the same problem
===
In traditional recursion, the typical model is that you perform your recursive calls first,
and then you take the return value of the recursive call and calculate the result. In this
 manner, you don't get the result of your calculation until you have returned from every recursive call.
+++
In tail recursion, you perform your calculations first, and then you execute the recursive call,
 passing the results of your current step to the next recursive step. This results in the last
 statement being in the form of "(return (recursive-function params))" (I think that's the syntax
for Lisp). Basically, the return value of any given recursive step is the same as the return value
 of the next recursive call.
+++
Tail Recursion is a specialized type of recursion where there is a guarantee that nothing is
 left to execute in the function after a recursive call. In other words, the function returns
 the result of a recursive call.
====
A function is tail-recursive if there is nothing left to do in the function after a recursive call.
===
A compiler is said to implement tail recursion if it reuses the current stack frame instead of
creating a new stack frame.
==
tail call optimization: the ability to call a function without allocating a new stack frame.
Can only happen if the called function is in the tail position.

Database sharding: a shared-nothing, horizontal partitioning scheme for large databases.
A large database is divided into multiple smaller databases. Rows of a table are distributed
among these smaller databases.

Helper method: a method that can be called from many places to perform some task.

Wrapper class: provide a different way to access another class/object. Scenarios:
(a) to hide complexity of another class (b) to perform something in a generic way (e.g.,
 multiple serialization formats using multiple classes). Almost like a facade.

mediator pattern: an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact

modular arithmetic: where numbers wrap around after they reach a certain value -> modulus
a = b (mod n) if a-b is an integer multiple of n.
e.g., 38=14 (mod 12) ; -8=7 (mod 5) ; 2=-3 (mod 5); -3=-8 (mod 5)
if same sign, a/n and b/n have the same remainder.

remainder: a=qd+r (a=dividend, q=quotient, d=divisor, r=remainder) and |r|<|d|
that means there are two possible remainders, one negative and the other positive.
Languages choose the remainder with the same sign as the dividend/divisor.

An inferior planet (closer to the sun than Earth - Mercury and Venus) is said to be "in inferior conjunction" when
 it is directly between the Earth and the Sun. It is "in superior conjunction" when it is on the opposite side of
the Sun from the Earth. The superior planets (the six planets farther from the Sun than Earth) are "in conjunction"
when it is on the opposite side of the Sun from the Earth. A superior planet obviously cannot have an
inferior conjunction.

New moon: the phase of the moon when the moon passes between the sun and the earth
New moon (original meaning): the sighting of the first crescent (the time and date depend on the
location of the observer)

Metonic cycle: 19 years is almost exactly equal to 235 synodic months
Synodic month: the time between two new moons.

Chinese calendar: 7 intercalary months every 19 years

Network address translation: the process of modifying IP address info in a network packet
 while the packet is in transit.
==> a way of sharing Internet IP addresses among many computers on a private network.
Typical: enable multiple hosts on a private network to access the Internet using a single public IP address.
---
NAT: allow machines with non-routable IP address to communicate across the internet.
===
How NAT works:
the firewall has a pool of valid public IP addresses.
when it receives a packet from a computer in a private network, the firewall replaces the original
source address with one of the IP addresses from the pool, records the original and replacement
IP addresses in a translation table, then forwards the modified packet to the internet.
---
True NAT is one-to-one, meaning each private IP address must be mapped to exactly one public IP address.
shortcoming: once the pool of public IP addresses is used up, additional users cannot connect to internet.
---------
NAT: It enables private IP networks that use unregistered IP addresses to connect to the Internet. NAT
operates on a router, usually connecting two networks together, and translates the private (not
globally unique) addresses in the internal network into legal addresses, before packets are
forwarded to another network.
======
IP Masquerade is a form of (1-to-many) Network Address Translation or NAT which allows internally connected
computers that do not have one or more registered Internet IP addresses to communicate to the
Internet via the Linux server's Internet IP address.
To other machines on the Internet, the outgoing traffic will appear to be from the IP MASQ Linux
server itself.
It is 1-to-many NAT because it only uses one public IP address for multiple machines.
It works by changing the IP address and port number in the network packet.

Port forwarding: a technique for allowing a remote computer to connect to a computer in a private network.
When configuring port forwarding, the network administrator sets aside one port number on the gateway
for the exclusive use of communicating with a service in the private network, located on a specific host.

Durian (how to choose)
1. shake it: if no sound, it is too ripe. hard knock: not ripe enough. dull, subtle knocks: just right
   should hear some slightly movement.
2. smell: neither too strong nor too raw
3. stem: very dry stem means it has been kept for a while. wet stem: fresh
4. choose one that is shapely rather than round

idempotent capability: network/hw failure can lead to lost messages. Need to resend.
May send multiple.
Design services to be idempotent: it means the system can safely accept multiple
copies of the same message.
Not all services can be idempotent (increment, decrement)
----
An idempotent HTTP method is a HTTP method that can be called many times without different outcomes.
Safe methods are HTTP methods that do not modify resources.

OOP identity: the property of an object that distinguishes it from other objects.
is whatever makes an object distinct from other objects.
What makes up the identity of an object in an object-oriented system? A common answer is "object identity" is defined by being in the same spot in memory, which is called "reference equality" and matches Java's == operator.

state object: an object that stores mutable state and is identified through reference equality
value object: is always immutable and is identified through value equality.

concurrency approaches: STM, msg-passing concurrency, dataflow concurrency.
other concurrency approaches: future/promise/delay, coroutine(??)
Software transactional memory (STM)
see the memory as a transactional db (begin/commit/rollback)

actor model of concurrency (message-passing concurrency)
actor: basic computational unit
is a lightweight process
communicate thru messages (sent/received through mailboxes (message queue))
asynchronous and non-blocking
no shared state

future/delay/promise: refer to constructs used for synchronizing in some concurrent programming languages. They
describe an object that acts as a proxy for a result that is initially unknown, usually because the
computation of its value is yet incomplete. Setting the value of a future is also called resolving,
fulfilling, or binding it.
--> a placeholder for something that you will get in the future.
---> future: an asynchronous task that computes a value for later use.
--> an object that immediately returns from an asynchronous message call. the future becomes
the result once the result is available. If you ask for the value of a future before the result
is available, the process blocks until the value is available.
--> future: a concurrency construct that allows an asynchronous return before computation is complete.
--> future: a construct that computes a value asynchronously and represents a value that will become
available in the future.
future/promise: an object that represents the result of an asynchronous function call.
future/promise: a placeholder for future results
future: a read-only placeholder for a future result
promise: can be written
----
The result of the future will be set by "someone else" - by the result of an asynchronous computation
===
On the other hand, the result of a promise can be set by "you" (or in fact by anybody) anytime
because it has a public setter method.

coroutine: a coroutine is a subroutine or function that can pause in the middle and return a value. When you
call it again it picks up right where it was when you paused, environment intact, and keeps on going.
Coroutines are almost always closures,
--> coroutines are symmetric units that explicitly activate each other; they do not return, but
resume each other.
--> coroutines are threads that are cooperatively scheduled. they yield to each other.

Java: take a threading approach to concurrency.
A process consists of one or more threads. Threads have their own execution path but share
resources with other threads in the same process. Shared resources lead to the need for locking.
To coordinate control between applications sharing resources, threading system require semaphore
or system-level locks.
--> threads with shared resources versus shared-nothing processes.
-> thread of execution: the smallest sequence of programmed instructions that can be managed independently by an operating system scheduler.
fiber: like thread, share address space, fibers use cooperative multitasking. threads use
preemptive multitasking. Threads often depend on the kernel's thread scheduler to preempt a busy thread and
resume another thread; fibers yield themselves to run another fiber while executing.
--> fiber describe the same concept as coroutine.
that coroutines are a language-level construct, a form of control flow, while fibers are a systems-level construct, viewed as threads that happen not to run concurrently

dataflow concurrency: a variable can only be assigned once in its lifetime.
if you read a variable before it is bound, you will block until someone assigns a value to it.

Parallelism refers to physically simultaneous execution. raise your arms in parallel.
--> requires multiple processing units.
Concurrency refers to conceptually simultaneous execution. juggling 3 balls (throw/catch one ball at a time).
--> can be implemented on a single processing unit.
execution agent: the number of core/CPU.

Global interpreter lock (GIL): is a mutual exclusion lock held by a programming language interpreter
thread to avoid sharing code that is not thread-safe with other threads
===
GIL is used to synchronize the execution of threads so that only one native thread can execute at a time.
Some language implementations that implement a Global Interpreter Lock are CPython, the most widely
used implementation of Python and Ruby MRI, the reference implementation of Ruby (where it is called Global VM Lock).

Typeface: A set of fonts in the same style. Or, in other words, a font family.
Ex: Times New Roman, Helvetica, or Arial.
Another acceptable way to refer to a typeface can be a font-family.
is a set of characters that share common design features.
====
Font: A single kind of typeface. Ex: Times New Roman in 10 point size is a font, and
Times New Roman in 14 point size is also a font. Times New Roman in Bold is also a font.
(Basically designating a specific type inside of a typeface is a font.)
----
Typeface is a broader term that describes the whole set and Font is the specific variation of a typeface.
====
Typesetting: the composition of text using types (or sorts: a stored letter in a mechanical system)
===
font is the delivery mechanism and a typeface is the creative work.
font is what you use, and typeface is what you see.

seizure: often used interchaneably with convulsion.
Convulsions are when a person's body shakes uncontrollably.
Seizures are episodes of disturbed brain activity that cause changes in attention or behavior.

clojure:

adapter (wrapper), monkey patch, multimethod, protocol

clojure: (defn blank? [s] (every? #(Character/isWhitespace %) s))

thread-local storage: a programming method that uses global memory local to a thread.
====
normally global variables are shared by all threads in a process. TLS is a mechanism
where each thread gets a private copy of a global variable.
----
normally all threads in a process share the same address space, which is sometimes undesirable.
In other words, data in a static or global variable is normally always located at the same memory location,
when referred to by threads from the same process. Variables on the call stack however are local to threads,
because each thread has its own stack, residing in a different memory location.
Sometimes it is desirable that two threads referring to the same static or global variable are actually
referring to different memory locations, thereby making the variable thread local, a canonical example
being the C error code variable errno.

lexical scope (also called static scoping or static scope) vs dynamic scope:
 In a lexically scoped language, the scope of an identifier is fixed at compile time to some region in
the source code containing the identifier's declaration. This means that an identifier is only accessible
within that region (including procedures declared within it).
dynamic scope: the scope depends on the nesting of functions at run time.
Perl and common lisp allow you to choose between static and dynamic scoping.
Most languages use static scoping
===
lexical scope: a variable can only be accessed within the block in which it is defined.

form follows function
the shape of an object should be based on its intended function or purpose.

Comet is a web application model in which a long-held HTTP request allows a web server to push data to a browser,
without the browser explicitly requesting it.
Comet is known by several other names, including Ajax Push, Reverse Ajax, Two-way-web, HTTP Streaming,
 and HTTP server push among others.

using a persistent or long-lasting HTTP connection between the server and the client.
The biggest hurdle is the HTTP 1.1 specification, which states that a browser should not have
more than two simultaneous connections with a web serve

referential transparency:
-- the same function with the same input will always return the same result.
a term commonly used in functional programming, means that given a function and an input value, you will always receive the same output.
With a referential transparent function, given an input and a function, you could replace it with a value instead of calling the function.
e.g., 5*5 can be replaced by 25.
referential opaqueness: Calling the function may not always produce the same output.

memoization:
a memoized function remembers the results for certain input values.
Subsequent calls with the remembered inputs will just return the remembered result
instead of recalculating it.
an optimization technique. optimized for speed in exchange for a higher use of memory.
memoization is a run-time optimization
--> means caching the result of a function/method call.
Can be done if a method always returns the same result for an input value (referential transparency).

forward proxy: takes requests from an internal network and forwards them to the internet.
reverse proxy: takes requests from the internet and forwards them to servers in an internal network.
---
Forward Proxy: Acting on behalf of a requestor (or service consumer), acts as an intermediary for its associated clients to contact any server.
Reverse Proxy: Acting on behalf of service/content producer, acts as an intermediary for its associated servers to be contacted by any client.

static binding: the function call is mapped to the function definition at compile time.
Dynamic binding: the function call is mapped to the function definition at run time.
virtual function (C++): declare virtual function if you want dynamic binding.

lexical variable: A lexical variable is a variable that can be referenced only within the lexical scope of the form that establishes that variable; lexical variables have lexical scope. Each time a form creates a lexical binding of a variable, a fresh binding is established.

expression problem:
how do you extend existing types to new methods and extend existing methods to new types
without changing existing code
OR: how do you add new types to existing methods and add new methods to existing types
without changing existing code
--> how do you create new types implementing existing interfaces and implement new interfaces
for existing types without recompiling existing code.

A cons cell is composed of two pointers; the car operation extracts the first pointer, and the cdr operation extracts the second.
When cons cells are used to implement singly linked lists (rather than trees and other more complicated structures), the car operation returns the first element of the list, while cdr returns the rest of the list. For this reason, the operations are sometimes given the names first and rest or head and tail.

SOLID:
single responsibility principle, open/closed principle, liskov substitution principle,
interface segregation, dependency inversion.
-->
Single responsibility: a class should have only one responsibility.
Open/closed: software should be open for extension, but closed for modification (means adding new
behavior with mininum changes to existing code)
Liskov substitution: if a program module is using a Base class, then the reference to the Base class can be replaced with a Derived class without affecting the functionality of the program module.
or: if S is a subtype of T, then objects of type T may be replaced with objects of type S without changing
the correctness of the program.
or: objects of a base class can be replaced with objects of a derived class without altering the correctness
of the program.
or:  must make sure that the new derived classes just extend without replacing the functionality of old classes. Otherwise the new classes can produce undesired effects when they are used in existing program modules.
--> Derived types must be completely substitutable for their base types.
--> BEST: objects should be replaceable by their subtypes
Interface segregation: a client should not be forced to implement interfaces it does not use.
--> clients should not have to depend on abstractions they don't use.
--> it is better to have many small interfaces than one big interface.
--> BEST: small, specific interfaces are better than monolithic ones.
Dependency inversion: high-level classes should not depend on low-level classes. both should
depend on abstractions. For example: Manager class has an inst var of class Worker (bad).
Should have an inst var of interface IWorker. The Worker class implements IWorker.
--> BEST: don't ask, let framework give it to you
--> another best: don't depend on concrete implementation, depend on interface

Reference equality: == (java)
Value equality: equals() (java)

reification: a process by which an abstract idea is turned into an object (or data model).
example:

POST vs PUT:
post: not idempotent. Post to example/users since you dont know the ID of the new object and youre asking the syetem to create one.
put: idempotent. Post to example/users/1234 since you know the ID already (create or update).
--> An idempotent method means that the result of a successful performed request is independent of the number of times it is executed

a fixed point of a function is a point that is mapped to itself by the function.
a value that, when given to a function, return itself.

CAP theorem
It is impossible for a distributed computer system to simultaneously provide all three of the following guarantees:
Consistency (all nodes see the same data at the same time)
Availability (all nodes can return data at any time): A guarantee that every request to the system receives a response about whether it was successful or not.
Partition tolerance (the system continues to operate as a whole even if individual nodes cannot be reached.)

According to the theorem, a distributed system can satisfy any two of these guarantees at the
same time, but not all three

The easiest way to understand CAP is to think of two nodes on opposite sides of a partition. Allowing at
least one node to update state will cause the nodes to become inconsistent, thus forfeiting C.
Likewise, if the choice is to preserve consistency, one side of the partition must
act as if it is unavailable, thus forfeiting A. Only when nodes communicate is it possible to preserve both
consistency and availability, thereby forfeiting P.

partition tolerant: distributed
if a node is disconnected from the rest of the system and it receives a query, it has two options:
(1) answer the query (available) even though the answer may not be consistent with the rest of the system
(2) not answer the query (consistent) because the answer may not be consistent
===

Consistency - Every read receives the most recent write or an error
Availability - Every request receives a response, without guarantee that it contains the most recent
version of the information
Partition Tolerance - The system continues to operate despite arbitrary partitioning due to network
failures

Maintaining strict consistency in a distributed system requires a synchronous coordination of all write operations between the nodes. This principle has two unpleasant side effects: (1) it adds latencies and increases response times; (2) it reduces the overall availability because multiple members must be available at the same time to complete a write operation.

Dropping strict consistency, on the other hand, solves the availability problem and eliminates the increased response time. The basic idea is to reestablish the global consistency after completing the write operation on a subset of the nodes. This approach leaves just one problem unsolved: it is impossible to prevent conflicts if two nodes accept contradictory changes. Consistency is eventually reached by handling conflicts, not by preventing them. In that context, consistency means that all nodes have the same data, it is not necessarily the correct or best data.

The PACELC theorem is an extension to the CAP theorem. It states that in case of network
partitioning (P) in a distributed computer system, one has to choose between availability (A) and
consistency (C) (as per the CAP theorem), but else (E), even when the system is running normally in
the absence of partitions, one has to choose between latency (L) and consistency (C).
--
Both theorems describe how distributed databases have limitations and tradeoffs regarding
consistency, availability, and partition tolerance. PACELC however goes further and states that a
trade-off also exists, this time between latency and consistency, even in absence of partitions,
thus providing a more complete portrayal of the potential consistency tradeoffs for distributed
systems.
--
A high availability requirement implies that the system must replicate data. As soon as a
distributed system replicates data, a tradeoff between consistency and latency arises.

Opposite of ACID:
BASE: Basically Available Soft-state wht Eventual consistency

Consistency in ACID: means that a transaction pre-serves all the database rules,
Consistency in CAP refers only to single copy consistency

aliasing: (in signal processing)
refers to an effect that causes different signals to become indistinguishable (or aliases of one another) when
sampled. It also refers to the distortion or artifact that results when the signal reconstructed from samples is
different from the original continuous signal.
related to digital audio: temporal aliasing
related to digital images: spatial aliasing

anti-aliasing:
In computer graphics, antialiasing is a software technique for diminishing jaggies - stairstep-like lines that
should be smooth. Jaggies occur because the output device, the monitor or printer, doesn't have a high enough
resolution to represent a smooth line. Antialiasing reduces the prominence of jaggies by surrounding the
stairsteps with intermediate shades of gray (for gray-scaling devices) or color (for color devices).
Although this reduces the jagged appearance of the lines, it also makes them fuzzier.
--> spatial anti-aliasing:
the technique of minimizing aliasing when representing a high-resolution image at a lower resolution

a standard that defines an interface between programs and Unix-like operating systems.
the purpose is to make it easier to port programs between systems.

prototype language: JavaScript, Io, Lua, Self
--> use the object, rather than the class, as the basis for object definition

string vs symbol:
2 strings with the same value can be 2 different objects in memory.
2 symbols with the same value always refer to the same object in memory.
String: used to hold data
symbol: used to name things
symbol: an identifier consisting of a string of characters.
Symbols are used to represent names.
you can have multiple string objects with the same value.
you cannot have multiple symbol objects with the same value.

power set: a set of all the subsets of a set.
if set is {a,b,c},
then power set is { {}, {a}, {b}, {c}, {a, b}, {a, c}, {b, c}, {a, b, c} }
the power set has 2^n members

library vs framework:
a library is a set of functions you can call.
library: you are in control. you call the library.
framework: fwk is in control. fwk calls your code.

ClassNotFoundException:
thrown when you try to load a class using its string name and the class cannot be found
--> Class:forName(), ClassLoader.findSystemClass(), ClassLoader.loadClass()
NoClassDefFoundError:
Thrown if the Java Virtual Machine or a ClassLoader instance tries to load in the definition of a class (as part of a normal method call or as part of creating a new instance using the new expression) and no definition of the class could be found. also static initializer. also class visibility problem between class loaders.
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: com/cheok/C
        at com.cheok.A.main(A.java:17)
Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: com.cheok.C

graceful degradation:
web page is designed for a particular browser version and would remain presentable or degrade if
older versions of browsers are used.
=====
start with modern browsers and provide workaround for older browsers.
--
graceful degradation: get your website working in all modern browsers and provide workaround
for older browsers.
---
progressive enhancement: start with a baseline of features supported by all browsers and then
add more features for the modern browsers that support them.
does not assume JavaScript is enabled and offer the user an alternative way of accessing the content.

graceful degradation and progressive enhancement: strategies for dealing with new features in
modern browsers and older unsupported browsers while offering the best user experience.

progressive enhancement:
the opposite of graceful degradation.
divide a web application into 3 components: HTML (structure), CSS (presentation), JavaScript (behavior)
--> a web design strategy that emphasizes accessibility to all devices, using a layered approach.
a basic HTML doc is created, geared towards the lowest common denominator of browser s/w functionality.
---
start with older browsers and add new features for modern browsers.

semantic HTML
Semantic HTML is the use of HTML markup to reinforce the semantics, or meaning, of the information in
webpages rather than merely to define its presentation (look). Semantic HTML is processed by regular web
browsers as well as by many other user agents. CSS is used to suggest its presentation to human users.
As an example, recent HTML standards discourage use of the tag <i> in preference of more specific tags
such as <em> (emphasis); the CSS stylesheet should then specify whether emphasis is denoted by an italic
font, a bold font, underlining, slower or louder audible speech etc. This is because italics are used for
purposes other than emphasis,
--> should not use presentational HTML markup such as <i>, <font>, etc
--
semantic html: use html tags to indicate the intent/meaning of content, not how the content should be
presented.

race condition
multiple threads access a resource at the same time, leading to unpredictable results.
===
The situation where multiple threads compete for the same resource, and the end result
depends on the order in which the resource is accessed.
====
race condition: incorrect behavior caused by threads interleaving and executing code in unintended order.

imperative programming: you tell the computer exactly how to do a job.

binding: the process of assigning parameters based on the inbound arguments.
destructuring: binding a set of variables to a corresponding set of values.
--> you take apart a data structure and grab only the pieces that are important to you.

fail-fast vs fail-safe
fail-fast Iterators fail as soon as they realized that structure of Collection has been changed since
iteration has begun. Structural changes means adding, removing or updating any element from
collection while one thread is Iterating over that collection. fail-fast behavior is implemented by
keeping a modification count and if iteration thread realizes the change in modification count it
throws ConcurrentModificationException.
Iterators returned by most of JDK1.4 collection are fail-fast including Vector, ArrayList, HashSet etc
--
fail-safe iterator doesn't throw any Exception if Collection is modified structurally
while one thread is Iterating over it because they work on clone of Collection instead of original
collection and thats why they are called as fail-safe iterator. Iterator of CopyOnWriteArrayList is an
example of fail-safe Iterator also iterator written by ConcurrentHashMap keySet is also fail-safe iterator
and never throw ConcurrentModificationException in Java.

project management triangle
aka triple constraint. cost, scope, time
pick any two: fast, good, cheap

buffer overflow
a program, when writing data to a buffer, overruns the buffer's boundary and overwrites
adjacent memory. C/C++ has no built-in protection against buffer overflow.
they do not check that data written to a buffer is within the boundaries of that buffer.

segmentation fault: means a program tries to access a memory location that it
is not allowed to access.
---
segmentation fault: memory access violation
---
Segmentation Fault (also known as SIGSEGV and is usually signal 11):
  You can get this message when the program tries to write/read outside the memory allocated for it or when writing memory which can only be read.
Bus Error (also known as SIGBUS and is usually signal 10) -
  You can encounter this signal error when an invalid pointer is dereferenced i.e when you try to dereference an uninitialised pointer. It is similar to SIGSEGV but the difference is that SIGSEGV indicates an invalid access to valid memory, while SIGBUS indicates an access to an invalid address.
bus error caterogy: Non-existent address, Unaligned access, Paging errors

too far in the future

semantic web: attach meaning to the services and information on the web.

ordered array: fast searching, slow insertion/deletion
linked list: slow searching, fast insertion/deletion
tree: fast searching and fast insertion/deletion: O(logN)

spatial locality
1. data has spatial locality if it is located close together in memory.
2. data/instruction close to recently accessed data/instruction are likely to be
accessed in the near future.
3. the use of data/resource within relatively close storage locations.
4. the use of data that are located close to one another.
5. resources that are near one another are likely to be accessed close together in time.
temporal locality
1. data has temporal locality if it is accessed at roughly the same time. (or recently accessed)
2. recently accessed data/instruction are likely to be accessed again in the near future.
3. the reuse of data/resource within a short time.
locality of reference = spatial locality and temporal locality
--> refers to the same data or related storage locations being frequently accessed.
--> Programs tend to reuse data and instructions they have used recently.

tuple: a fixed-length set of objects
tuple: an ordered list of elements (like an ordered collection)

In OOP, need to handle this problem: an object can have several different roles.
C++: multiple inheritance
Java: interface
Ruby: mixin
Scala: trait

dark moon: moon is directly between the sun and the earth. moon is invisible from earth.
new moon: first crescent (depends on location of observer).
beginning of islamic, hebrew, hindu calendar month: new moon
beginning of chinese calendar month: dark moon
dark moon comes before new moon. chinese 1 comes before islamic 1.

functional programming
1. programs are made up of functions
2. a function always returns a value
3. a function given the same input will always return the same value
3. functional programs avoid changing state or mutating data (immutability).
--> functioinal programming: emphasizes the evaluation of function and immutability
--> functional programming is programming without assignment statements.
best practices:
a function must take at least one argument
a function must return data or another function
no loop
---
how you divide up a problem depends on how you put the solutions together.
FP: provides two new kinds of glue: higher-order functions and lazy evaluation.
allow greatly improved modularization
functions that are indivisible in conventional languages can be expressed as a
combination of functions.
lazy evaluation: g(f(x)): g() and f() are run in synchronization.
f() is only started when g() tries to read some input, and only run long
enough to deliver the output g() is trying to read. Then f() is suspended and g() is run
until it tries to read another input. f() is terminated as soon as g() is terminated.
f() can be a non-terminating function.
--> delaying execution until the value is needed

list comprehension:
a syntactic construct for creating a list based on existing lists.
Smalltalk example: ((1 to: 100) select: [:x|x*x>3]) collect: [:x|2*x]
--> follows the form of set comprehension:
a mathematical notation for describing a set by stating the properties that its members must satisfy.

call with current continuation: (call/cc)
(call/cc F): takes one argument F
F is expected to be a function that takes one argument C.
C represents the current continuation. C is a function that takes one argument.
Invoking C in F will force execution of the program to jump to the point where call/cc was called.
The argument to C is the return value of call/cc.
---
continuation: allow you to save the execution state of your program and later return to the same point.

--> call-with-current-continuation allows you to save the state of a computation, package it up as a data structure, and go off and do something else. Whenever you want, you can restore the old saved state, abandoning the current computation and and picking up where the saved computation left off.
--> allows you to implement advanced control structures such as backtracking, cooperative multitasking, and custom exception-handling.

backtracking: a general algorithm for finding all (or some) solutions to some computational problem, that
incrementally builds candidates to the solutions, and abandons each partial candidate c ("backtracks")
as soon as it determines that c cannot possibly be completed to a valid solution
--> an attempt to re-satisfy the last satisfied goal when the next goal fails.
---
A backtracking algorithm tries to build a solution to a computational problem incrementally.
Whenever the algorithm needs to decide between multiple alternatives to the next component of
the solution, it simply tries all possible options recursively
---
backtracking: an algorithm that builds a solution incrementally. when it is clear that the current
path does not lead to a solution, you go back to the previous decision point and take the next choice.
==
in backtracking ,We start with one possible move out of many available moves and try to solve the
problem if we are able to solve the problem with the selected move then we will print the
solution else we will back­track and select some other move and try to solve it. If none if the
moves work out we will claim that there is no solution for the problem.
---
backtracking: recursive. works by incrementally building candidates to the final solution.
at each step, you choose a candidate.
as soon as you realize that this path cannot lead to the final solution, you abandon
this candidate, go back one level up, and choose another candidate.
---
backtracking: let's say you have a problem that is solved by making a series of choices.
when you reach a dead end, you go back to the previous decision point and take the next choice.

--> Securitization is the financial practice of pooling various types of contractual debt such as residential mortgages, commercial mortgages, auto loans or credit card debt obligations and selling said consolidated debt as bonds, pass-through securities, or Collateralized mortgage obligation (CMOs), to various investors. The principal and interest on the debt, underlying the security, is paid back to the various investors regularly.
--> An asset-backed security is a security whose value and income payments are derived from and collateralized (or "backed") by a specified pool of underlying assets. The pool of assets is typically a group of small and illiquid assets that are unable to be sold individually. Pooling the assets into financial instruments allows them to be sold to general investors, a process called securitization, and allows the risk of investing in the underlying assets to be diversified because each security will represent a fraction of the total value of the diverse pool of underlying assets.
--> a mortgage-backed security (MBS) is an asset-backed security that represents a claim on the cash flows from mortgage loans through a process known as securitization.

pangram: a sentence that uses every letter of the alphabet at least once.
e.g. the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.

deadlock: a situation in which two or more competing actions are each waiting for the other to finish, and
thus neither ever does. processes are stuck due to circular dependencies.
livelock: similar to a deadlock, except that the states of the processes involved in the livelock constantly
change with regard to one another, none progressing
--
Deadlock describes a situation where two or more threads are blocked forever, waiting for each other.
--
Starvation describes a situation where a thread is unable to gain regular access to shared resources and is unable to make progress.
starvation: when threads are not getting enough execution time to carry out their tasks.

heterotroph: An organism that cannot synthesize its own food and is dependent on complex organic substances for nutrition.

erlang atom : self-indicating identifiers
can I apply this description to smalltalk/ruby symbol or lisp keyword?

force majeure: superior force; unexpected or uncontrollable event

closure: anonymous functions with closed scope
it carries around the context in which it was defined.
a block can reference the variables that were in scope when it was defined,
even if those variables later go out of scope.
---
closure: an anonymous function that references variables defined outside the scope of the function
has access to its outer scope even after the outer scope has returned.
---
Formally, a closure is a technique for implementing lexically scoped named binding. It is a way of
storing a function with an environment.
--
A closure is a scope which captures local variables of a function for access even after the
execution has moved out of the block in which it is defined

jumbo loan: a loan above the conforming loan limit.
the conforming loan limit is set by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which are
government-sponsored enterprises that purchase residential mortgages from
banks, allowing them to free up money to lend more mortgages.

aspect-oriented programming (AOP): allow separation of cross-cutting concerns (logging, transaction,
security, persistence). In OO code, a behavior is often repeated in multiple classes or spread
across multiple methods. AOP allows you to abstract this behavior and apply it to classes and methods
without using inheritance.

homoiconicity: Expressing the language in its own data structures
code is represented using its own data structure
Lisp code, its textual representation, is written in the same format as its internal representation (AST). Such a property is called homoiconicity,

An Armstrong number is an n-digit number that is equal to the sum of the nth powers of its individual digits.
example: 371 = 3**3 + 7**3 + 1**3

quine: a program that prints its own source code.

liar paradox: "this sentence is false"
Quine's paradox: "Yields falsehood when preceded by its quotation" yields falsehood when preceded by its quotation.

hygienic marco: means that variables defined within macro code are renamed, or subject to some other transformation, in order to avoid name clashes with the code surrounding the macro call site.

knapsack problem: a problem in combinatorial optimization: Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible. It derives its name from the problem faced by someone who is constrained by a fixed-size knapsack and must fill it with the most valuable items.
--> Combinatorial optimization is a topic that consists of finding an optimal object from a finite set of objects.
--> we have a knapsack with a limited capacity. we have a number of items, each of which has a weight
and a value. the problem is put one or more items in the knapsack such that the we have the maximum value
without exceeding the capacity of the knapsack.
====
knapsack problem: Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the number of each item to
include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the
total value is as large as possible.
example: given a set of boxes with a weight and an amount of money, which boxes should be chosen to
maximize the amount of money while still keeping the overall weight under or equal to 15 kg?
===
knapsack problem can be written as an integer linear programming problem.

clojure: persistent data structure: means that the data structure is immutable, yet has efficient
non-destructive operations that correspond to the operations on the classical hash table. The word
efficient means on par with their mutating counterparts.

time complexity: quantifies the amount of time taken by an algorithm.
--> quantifies the running time of an algorithm based on the size of the dataset.
--> defined in terms of the order of magnitude of the number of operations required to perform a function.
commonly expressed using the big O notation.
constant time: O(1)
linear time: O(n)
logarithmic time: O(log n)
polynomial time: O(n^k). quicksort: O(n^2). Most familiar mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as computing square roots, powers, and logarithms, can be performed in polynomial time. Computing the digits of most interesting mathematical constants, including pi and e, can also be done in polynomial time.
--> Non-deterministic turing machine: A nondeterministic Turing machine is a "parallel" Turing machine that can take many computational paths simultaneously, with the restriction that the parallel Turing machines cannot communicate.
--> NP-problem: A problem is assigned to the NP (nondeterministic polynomial time) class if it is solvable in polynomial time by a nondeterministic Turing machine.
--> NP-hard: A problem is NP-hard if an algorithm for solving it can be translated into one for solving any NP-problem (nondeterministic polynomial time) problem. NP-hard therefore means "at least as hard as any NP-problem," although it might, in fact, be harder.
--> NP-Complete : A problem which is both NP (verifiable in nondeterministic polynomial time) and NP-hard (any NP-problem can be translated into this problem). Examples of NP-hard problems include the Hamiltonian cycle and traveling salesman problems.
Big O: upper bound, worst case
Big Omega: lower bound, best case
Big Theta: when best and worst case are the same, can use Big Theta
these are called asymptotic functions: because they capture the growth of a function
as its argument asymptotically approaches infinity.
===
O(n): say it like "Big O of N"
O(logN): say it like "Big O of log N"

in-place algorithm: uses a small constant amount of extra space, usually overwrites the input space.

python generator: a function that generates a sequence of values instead of a single value.
--> a function that stops in the middle, returns a value to the caller, and later on
picks up where it left off.
Generators decouple iteration from the code that uses the results of the iteration
The function only executes on next()
yield produces a value, but suspends the function
Function resumes on next call to next()
One of the most powerful applications of generators is setting up processing pipelines
When you call a coroutine, nothing happens
They only run in response to next() and send()
Generators produce values
Coroutines tend to consume values

Tell me how you measure me and I will tell you how I behave.

off-side rule: the scope of a block is indicated by its indentation

interview stuff:
most challenging
what you learned
most interesting
hardest bug

conflicts with teammates

compiler: translate source code into machine language
linker: combines multiple object files into an an executable program.

abstract data type: defined by the operations that may be performed on it and its implementation is hidden.

Von Neumann architexture: memory that contains data and instructions; and a processing unit.
processing unit takes instruction and data out of memory, manipuate the data and store the result
to some memory cells. Repeat.
two characteristics: sequential step-by-step execution of instructions and mutable data.

orthogonality: means that any composition of the basic primitives should be allowed. This would
achive the greatest degree of generality.

Dunning-Kruger effect: is a cognitive bias in which unskilled individuals suffer from illusory superiority, mistakenly rating their ability much higher than average.
--> the miscalibration of the incompetent stems from an error about the self, whereas the miscalibration of the highly competent stems from an error about others
--> when incompetent people not only fail to realise their incompetence, but consider themselves much more competent than everyone else. Basically, they're too stupid to know that they're stupid.
--> the incompetent overestimate their ability.
--> the competent underestimate their ability.
--> a little knowledge is a dangerous thing

In a web browser, an access key or accesskey allows a computer user immediately to jump to a specific part of a web page via the keyboard.

first sale doctrine: the purchaser of a copyrighted work can resell or give away or destroy the copyrighted work
without the permission of the copyright owner.

currying: converting a function that takes multiple arguments into a chain of functions that take one argument.
currying: the conversion of a multi-argument function into a chain of single-argument functions.
currying: converting a multi-argument function into a chain of single-argument functions such that each one
          returns the next function until the last one returns the result.
example: f(x,y) becomes (f'(x))(y)
example: a function which takes two ints and returns a float is curried into a function which takes an
int and returns a function which takes an int and returns a float. In this world, partial
application just happens without any extra code
benefits of currying: easier to reuse?
=====
partial application: the conversion of a multi-argument function into one that accepts fewer arguments by
        providing fixed values for the omitted arguments.
partial application: Partially applying a function means creating a new function by pre-filling some
of the arguments to the original function.
---
currying vs partial application
--> Where partial application takes a function and from it builds a function which takes fewer arguments, currying builds functions which take multiple arguments by composition of functions which each take a single argument.

Java web application: model 1 vs model 2 (two usage patterns for JSP pages)
Model 1: logic is contained within JSP pages.
-->
Model 2 JSP programming
1. requests from browsers are passed to the controller (servlet)
2. controller obtains the correct content for display (from model (POJO, beans))
3. controller then passes content to a view (JSP pages)
4. view renders the content
In model 2, logic is in servlet. JSP only renders the content.
--> Model 1 and Model 2 simply refer to the absence or presence (respectively) of a controller servlet that dispatches requests from the client tier and selects views.

association list: a list where each node is a key-value pair. like a dictionary. search is O(n)

setuid, setgid: allow users to execute a program with the access rights of the program's owner or group.
Normally, the permission rights of a process is the same as the user who executes the process.
setuid/setgid allow users to execute programs with temporarily elevated privileges in order to
perform a specific task.
Needed for tasks that require higher privileges.
The user who executes the program gains the privileges of the user who owns the program.
-->
Setting the setgid permission on a directory (chmod g+s) causes new files and subdirectories created within it to
inherit its group ID, rather than the primary group ID of the user who created the file (the owner ID is never
affected, only the group ID). Newly created subdirectories inherit the setgid bit.
---
unix: setuid bit, setgid bit, sticky bit
sticky bit: chmod +x <dirname> : a file in the dir can only be deleted/renamed by the owner of the file,
or the owner of the directory, or superuser
---
sticky bit: set on a directory.
if it is set, the only user who can rename or remove any file is the file's owner, the directory's owner,
or superuser.
--> Normally, if you have write permssion for a directory, you can rename or remove files not owned by you.
==
real user id: identify the user who owns the process
effective user id: used by the OS to decide whether the process is allowed to do something.

federated database:
a system in which several databases appear to function as a single entity. Each component database in the system is completely self-sustained and functional. When an application queries the federated database, the system figures out which of its component databases contains the data being requested and passes the request to it. Federated databases can be thought of as database virtualization in much the same way that storage virtualization makes several drives appear as one.

x window primary selection: highlight text with left mouse button, paste with middle button
x window clipboard: do "Edit/copy" and "Edit/paste" explicitly.

lisp: non-terminating dispatching macro character. example: #
a character that has an associated table that specifies the function to be called for each character
that follows the dispatching macro character.
non-terminating: being treated as a constituent character when it appears in the middle of an extended token.

-- network gateway
A gateway is a network point that acts as an entrance to another network. On the Internet, a node or stopping point can be either a gateway node or a host (end-point) node. Both the computers of Internet users and the computers that serve pages to users are host nodes. The computers that control traffic within your company's network or at your local Internet service provider (ISP) are gateway nodes.
In the network for an enterprise, a computer server acting as a gateway node is often also acting as a proxy server and a firewall server. A gateway is often associated with both a router, which knows where to direct a given packet of data that arrives at the gateway, and a switch, which furnishes the actual path in and out of the gateway for a given packet.
proxy server: receive a request from a computer, request a page from a server on the internet,
then forwards it to the user.
firewall: prevent outsiders from accessing a private network and control what outside resources
firewall: a barrier that controls what kind of data comes into and out of your network
users can access
-- SOCKS
a protocol that a proxy server can use to accept requests from client users in a company's network so that it can forward them across the Internet.
is a network protocol designed to allow clients to communicate with Internet servers through firewalls.
SOCKS: a protocol that routes network packets between a client and server through a proxy server.

CMS vs RDBMS (like car vs diesel engine)
CMS is a full-blown system allowing end-users to view and modify content (articles, media, etc.) in an easy way.
RDBMS  is a back-end software used to store low-level data.
CMSes use RDBMSes (like MySQL)

have no truck with sth
to have nothing to do with something, refuse to become involved with something
 to want nothing to do with sth

hard link: cannot create a hard link to a directory. cannot cross a file system.

OSI model: a conceptual model that defines the internal functions of a communications system by partitioning
it into seven layers. think of the layers as an assembly line. At each layer, certain things happen
to the data that prepare it for the next layer.
Application set: layer 5,6,7. transport set: 1,2,3,4
Layer 7 (application): this layer interacts with the OS.
layer 6 (presentation): Layer 6 takes the data provided by the Application layer and converts it into a standard format that the other layers can understand
layer 5 (session): Layer 5 establishes, maintains and ends communication with the receiving device.
layer 4 (transport): This layer maintains flow control of data and provides for error checking and recovery of data between the devices. Flow control means that the Transport layer looks to see if data is coming from more than one application and integrates each application's data into a single stream for the physical network.
layer 3 (network): The way that the data will be sent to the recipient device is determined in this layer. Logical protocols, routing and addressing are handled here.
layer 2 (data link): In this layer, the appropriate physical protocol is assigned to the data. Also, the type of network and the packet sequencing is defined.
layer 1 (physical): This is the level of the actual hardware. It defines the physical characteristics of the network such as connections, voltage levels and timing.

TCP/IP:
Layer 1: Network Interface - This layer combines the Physical and Data layers and routes the data between devices on the same network. It also manages the exchange of data between the network and other devices.
Layer 2: Internet - This layer corresponds to the Network layer. The Internet Protocol (IP) uses the IP address, consisting of a Network Identifier and a Host Identifier, to determine the address of the device it is communicating with.
Layer 3: Transport - Corresponding to the OSI Transport layer, this is the part of the protocol stack where the Transport Control Protocol (TCP) can be found. TCP works by asking another device on the network if it is willing to accept information from the local device.
Layer 4: Application - Layer 4 combines the Session, Presentation and Application layers of the OSI model. Protocols for specific functions such as e-mail (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, SMTP) and file transfer (File Transfer Protocol, FTP) reside at this level.

lisp reduce:
expect 2-arg function
e.g. (reduce 'func '(1 2 3)) ==> (func (func 1 2) 3)

endorsement: Signing a legal document in a legal capacity.
To endorse a promissory note as a third-party means the endorser guarantees payment in case the principal borrower defaults.

drawer
writer of a bill of exchange (check, draft, letter of credit, etc.) who directs the drawee (such as a bank) to
pay the stated amount to a third party (the payee).

third-party check
If somebody gives you a check, and you turn it over and write "pay to the order of ____" in order to give it to a
third party, that makes it a third party check. An example would be using your paycheck to pay for your groceries.

fold, aka reduce, inject (smalltalk)
example list: [1,2,3], function: +
left fold: (1+2)+3
right fold: 1+(2+3)

oracle: RLS (row-level security), VPD (virtual private database)
restrict access to rows and columns based on a security policy

interior gateway protocol (IGP):
a protocol for exchanging routing information between gateways (hosts with routers) within an autonomous network (for example, a system of corporate local area networks). two types: Routing Information Protocol (RIP) and the Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) protocol.

exterior gateway protocol (EGP):
a protocol for exchanging routing information between two neighbor gateway hosts (each with its own router) in a network of autonomous systems. now replaced by border gateway way protocol (BGP).

looking glass server:
allows you to see routing info.
a piece of software running as a CGI on an ISP's webserver that allows external users to get a look at routing and network behavior within their network.

discretionary access control (DAC)
a means of restricting access to objects based on the identity of subjects and/or groups to which they belong.
the subject can change the permissions of objects.
example: unix user and group id
--> Mandatory Access Control (MAC) is a type of access control in which only the administrator manages the access controls. The administrator defines the usage and access policy, which cannot be modified or changed by users, and the policy will indicate who has access to which programs and files.
--> mandatory access control (MAC) refers to a type of access control by which the operating system constrains the ability of a subject or initiator to access or generally perform some sort of operation on an object or target.
--> Role-based access control (RBAC) is a method of regulating access to computer or network resources based on the roles of individual users within an enterprise. In this context, access is the ability of an individual user to perform a specific task, such as view, create, or modify a file. Roles are defined according to job competency, authority, and responsibility within the enterprise.

autoboxing: automatic conversion from primitive types to object wrapper classes.

liveness: A concurrent application's ability to execute in a timely manner is known as its liveness.

crossing the memory barrier (java):
the copying of data from local memory (registers/cache) to main memory and vice versa.
when? synchronized, volatile,

java synchronized:
When one thread is executing a synchronized method for an object, all other threads that invoke synchronized methods for the same object block (suspend execution) until the first thread is done with the object.
--when a synchronized method exits, it automatically establishes a happens-before relationship with any subsequent invocation of a synchronized method for the same object. This guarantees that changes to the state of the object are visible to all threads.
----
happens-before relationship:
is a guarantee that memory written to by statement A is visible to statement B, that is, that statement A completes its write before statement B starts its read
Memory consistency errors occur when different threads have inconsistent views of what should be the same data.
---
a guarantee that state changes made by one thread is visible to all threads.
---
happened-before relationship  is a guarantee that memory written to by statement A is visible to statement B,
that is, that statement A completes its write before statement B starts its read
---
happens-before relationship: a guarantee that state changes made by one thread is visible to another thread.
happens-before relationship: it relates only to visibilities of an effect. does not mandate execution order.
==
The results of a write by one thread are guaranteed to be visible to a read by another thread only
if the write operation happens-before the read operation. The synchronized and volatile constructs,
as well as the Thread.start() and Thread.join() methods, can form happens-before relationships.

In concurrent programming, a monitor is a synchronization construct that allows threads to have both mutual exclusion and the ability to wait (block) for a certain condition to become true. Monitors also have a mechanism for signalling other threads that their condition has been met.
--
monitor : a construct that allows threads to gain exclusive access to an object. it also allows threads to wait (block) for a certain
condition and to signal other threads that the condition has been met.
 supports two kinds of thread synchronization: mutual exclusion and cooperation
----
Synchronization is built around an internal entity known as the intrinsic lock or monitor lock.
Every object has an intrinsic lock associated with it. By convention, a thread that needs exclusive and consistent access to an object's fields has to acquire the object's intrinsic lock before accessing them, and then release the intrinsic lock when it's done with them.
--
When a thread invokes a synchronized method, it automatically acquires the intrinsic lock for that method's object and releases it when the method returns.
---
Allowing a thread to acquire the same lock more than once enables reentrant synchronization.
-- java synchronized keyword:
The memory representation in different threads of the object being locked is being synchronized.
after the synchronized block is completed, all changes made to the locked object are flushed
to main memory before the lock is released.
before the synchronized block is entered, all changes to the locked object are read in from main
memory.
--> volatile keyword:
the value seen by a thread is always re-read from main memory before use.
any changed value is flushed to main memory before the instruction is completed.
--
The java.lang.Thread.join() method waits for this thread to die.
the Java wait/notify mechanism is essentially a way to communicate between threads.
wait(): release the lock and the thread is suspended.
wait() is used when you are waiting for some condition that is under the control of another thread.
Once notification arrives, the JVM wakens the waiting thread, which then tries to reacquire the lock.
wait() and notify() must be called from a synchronized context to avoid a potential race condition:
the notify() comes before the wait(). and the waiting thread waits forever.
race condition detail:
Thread A tests a condition and discovers it must wait.
Thread B sets the condition and calls notify() to inform A to resume execution. Because A is not yet waiting, nothing happens.
Thread A waits, by calling wait().
Because of the prior notify() call, A waits indefinitely.
---> wait() and notify() compete for the same lock.
--
synchronized method: acquire the monitor for the method's object.
static synchronized method: acquire the monitor for the Class object.
---
mutual exclusion: means only one thread is in the critical section at any one time.
critical section: when a shared resource is being accessed. cannot be executed by more than one thread at a time.
semaphore: a variable for controlling access to a common resource.
====
synchronization: controlling access to a shared resource.
-----
synchronizes-with: means that an action will synchronize its view of an object with main memory

---
requirements:
The key is at least as long as the message or data that must be encrypted.
The key is truly random (not generated by a simple computer function or such)
Key and plaintext are calculated modulo 10 (digits), modulo 26 (letters) or modulo 2 (binary)

There should only be two copies of the key: one for the sender and one for the receiver (some exceptions exist for multiple receivers)

transaction isolation level
Serializable, Repeatable read (phantom read problem), Read committed (non-repeatable read problem),
Read uncommitted (dirty read problem)

certificate authority, or certification authority (CA), is an entity that issues digital certificates.
a root certificate is either an unsigned public key certificate or a self-signed certificate that identifies the Root Certificate Authority (CA)
Digital certificates are verified using a chain of trust. The trust anchor for the digital certificate is the Root Certificate Authority (CA).

public key certificate
an electronic document that uses a digital signature to bind a public key with an identity
--> The certificate can be used to verify that a public key belongs to an individual.
In a typical public key infrastructure (PKI) scheme, the signature will be of a certificate authority (CA). In a web of trust scheme, the signature is of either the user (a self-signed certificate) or other users ("endorsements"). In either case, the signatures on a certificate are attestations by the certificate signer that the identity information and the public key belong together.
--
digital signature:
demonstrate the authenticity of a message.  A valid digital signature gives a recipient reason to believe that the message was created by a known sender, such that the sender cannot deny having sent the message (authentication and non-repudiation) and that the message was not altered in transit (integrity).
-- first : generate private key and a corresponding public key.
-- A signing algorithm that, given a message and a private key, produces a signature.
-- A signature verifying algorithm that, given a message, public key and a signature, either accepts or rejects the message's claim to authenticity.

queue starvation:
Its a problem that can occur when scheduling tasks in priority queues if there are too many high priority tasks
so that lower priority tasks never get scheduled and are just waiting indefinitely. For example, lets say we
have three queues: high, medium and low priority. Tasks in the high priority one always get processed first.
Once this queue is empty the tasks from the medium priority queue get processed. Of course the tasks in the
low priority queue get processed only if the other two queues are empty. If there are too many high and
medium priority tasks incoming all the time so that the queues never get empty, then the low priority tasks
are not processed at all.
-- If high priority processes use up a lot of CPU time, lower priority processes may starve and be
postponed indefinitely. The situation where a process never gets scheduled to run is called starvation

your way thru the API. The response contains links.
GET: safe and idempotent
PUT and DELETE: idempotent but not safe

REST (RESTful):
It is a set of design principles for making network communication more scalable and flexible.
In order to be consider RESTful, a system must satisfy six constraints.
#1: client-server
#2: stateless. the client and server do not keep track of each other's state. i.e. no session
#3: uniform interface
  a. identification of resource -> each resource must be uniquely identified by an identifier.
  b. manipulation of resources thru representation -> if a client wants to change a resource,
     it sends a representation of what it would like the resulting resource to look like.
  c. self-descriptive messages -> a message that contains all the information needed to process it
  d. hypermedia -> HATEOAS. hypermedia should be used to find your way thru the API. The response contains links.
     The response contains information about what the client can do next.
     the response contains links that allow the client to navigate thru the API.
     Resource discoverability thru links.
     hypermedia: hyperlinks within hypertext
#4: cacheable: responses must define themselves as cacheable or not.
#5: layered system: a client cannot tell whether it is directly communicating with the end server, or
    thru an intermediary.
#6: code on demand (optional): the server can send executable code to the client.

wire-level protocol is a description of the format of the data that is sent across the network as a stream of octets

oracle execution plan:
access predicate: we are using something to "access" the data - we only "access" relevant data.
In general - you'll see "access" when using an index for example. We are using the index to "access" only the rows of interest.
filter predicate: we are getting more data then we need, and we filter it after we get it.

DB join:
A join combines the output from exactly two row sources, such as tables or views, and returns one row source. The returned row source is the data set.

A join condition compares two row sources using an expression. The join condition defines the relationship between the tables. If the statement does not specify a join condition, then the database performs a Cartesian join (see "Cartesian Joins"), matching every row in one table with every row in the other table.

In general, nested loops joins work best on small tables with indexes on the join conditions.

The optimizer always tries to put the smallest row source first, making it the driving table.
nested loop:
 The optimizer determines the driving table and designates it as the outer table.
 The other table is designated as the inner table.
 For every row in the outer table, Oracle accesses all the rows in the inner table. The outer loop is for every row in the outer table and the inner loop is for every row in the inner table. The outer loop appears before the inner loop in the execution plan, as follows:
--> fetch the result from one table and query the other table for each row from the first

NESTED LOOPS
  outer_loop
  inner_loop

hash join: A method for joining large data sets. The database uses the smaller of two data sets to build a hash table on the join key in memory. It then scans the larger data set, probing the hash table to find the joined rows.
The indexing strategy for a hash join is very different because there is no need to index the join columns. Only indexes for independent where predicates improve hash join performance.
--> build a hash table from the samller data set, then for each row in the larger data set, probe the hash table for a match.
Hash joins can not look up rows from the inner (probed) row source based on values retrieved from the outer (driving) row source, nested loops can.
When joining table A and B (A being driving table and B being the probed table), then hash joins can not perform index lookups into table B based on the values returned from table A

java volatile keyword: Reads and writes are atomic for all variables declared volatile (including long and double variables).
--> indicate the var will be modified by multiple threads.
--> the values will always be read from main memory.

Both CyclicBarrier and CountDownLatch are used to implement a scenario where one Thread waits for one or more Thread to complete there job before starts processing but there is one Difference between CountDownLatch and CyclicBarrier in Java which separates them apart and that is, you can not reuse same CountDownLatch instance once count reaches to zero and latch is open, on the other hand CyclicBarrier can be reused by resetting Barrier, Once barrier is broken.

switch: pole and throw
pole: the number of circuits controlled by the switch

Semantic Versioning: giving meaning to version numbers
Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:
MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.
---
major: breaking changes
minor: new features, non-breaking change
patch: bug fixes
---
A breaking change happens whenever you as a developer and consumer of a library, have to step in and
adjust your code after a version upgrade

fruit: the ripened ovary of flowering plant. fruits have seeds.
fruit: the mature ovary of a flower, containing the seed
vegetable is the part of a plant that is edible and does not have a role in the reproductive cycle.
green bean, cucumber, tomato, green pepper is a fruit
strawberry: an aggregate accessory fruit, not a berry, the flesh is derived not from the ovary, but from the receptacle that holds the ovary.
berry: a fleshy fruit produced from a single ovary,

Docker is a container virtualization technology that offers the promise of a more efficient, lightweight approach to application deployment than most organizations are currently implementing. With a traditional virtualization hypervisor like VMware ESX, Microsoft Hyper-V or the open-source Xen and Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) technologies, each virtual machine (VM) needs its own operating system. In contrast, with Docker, applications sit inside a container that resides on a single host operating system, that can serve many containers.
--  hypervisor abstracts an entire device, containers just abstract the operating system kernel.
-- container: share OS, and where applicable, bins/libraries
-- developers can use Docker to pack, ship, and run any application as a lightweight, portable, self sufficient LXC container that can run virtually anywhere
-- It can get more applications running on the same hardware than other technologies; it makes it easy for developers to quickly create, ready-to-run containered applications; and it makes managing and deploying applications much easier

SQL union vs union all
union concatenates the results of two SQL queries:
example:
--
select ref_num from shp_dnd_record where ref_num = '51X4JM9'
union all select category from shp_dnd_detail where dnd_record_id = 6373409;
--
union : remove duplicates
union all: does not remove duplicates
---
Union vs full outer join:
Union is vertical - rows from table1 followed by rows from table2 (distinct for union, all for union all)
and both table must have same number of columns with compatible datatypes.
Full outer join is horizontal. Number of rows in full outer join is max of table1 and table 2 rows and number of columns = table1 columns + table2 columns.

bit mask: a value used with bit-wise operators to test, set, or reset the state of individual bits in a bit-wise field value.
bit vector: a data structure which compactly stores individual bits (boolean values).
mask: A filter that selectively includes or excludes certain values.

SLA: A contract between a service provider and a customer that specifies the customer's requirements and the provider's commitments.

Thread-safe: A piece of code is thread-safe if it is reentrant or protected from multiple simultaneous executions by some form of mutual exclusion.
A piece of code is reentrant if it functions correctly during simultaneous execution by multiple threads.
A subroutine is reentrant, and thus thread-safe, if it only uses variables from the stack, depends only on the arguments passed in,
and only calls other subroutines with similar properties.
Thread-safety can be achieved through: (a) reentrancy (b) mutual exclusion (c) thread-local storage (d) atomic operations.
Thread safety means that an object always maintains a valid state, even when used concurrently by multiple threads. Safe for use by multiple threads.

Instrumentation: the insertion of additional code into a program in order to collect information about program behavior during program execution.
Useful for dynamic analysis techniques such as assertion checking, coverage analysis, tuning.
--
Instrumentation is limited by execution coverage. If the program never reaches a particular point of
execution, then instrumentation at that point collects no data

Assertion: an expression, if false, indicates an error.

Scalability:
The ability of a system to accommodate growth.
Scalability measures the ability of a system to deliver consistent performance while the workload increases
---- scalability meanings:
redundancy in the face of server failure
managing increasing read load
managing increasing data set size
managing increasing write load

diamond problem: the ambiguity that can result from multiple inheritance.

generalization: a relationship between a thing and a more specific kind of that thing.

container (or wrapper) format: define how to store things within them, not what kind of data is stored
a metafile format whose specification describes how different elements of data and metadata coexist in a computer file.
--> a metadata format that describes how to store different data elements in a computer file.
--> does not describe how data is encoded.
therefore, a program may be able to identify and open a container file, but it
might not be able to decode the contained data. This may be caused by the program lacking the required decoding algorithm.
example container formats: MPEG-4 (.mp4), Flash (.flv), Ogg (.ogv), WebM (.webm), Audio Video Interleave (.avi)
===
audio coding format:

fork-join paradigm:
In parallel computing, the fork–join model is a way of setting up and executing parallel programs,
such that execution branches off in parallel at designated points in the program, to "join" (merge) at a subsequent point and resume sequential execution.

koan (software):
a demonstration of a feature with something missing.
you provide the missing value to make the test case pass.
A koan is a small snippet of almost-correct code,

functor
A functor is a mapping between two categories that preserves their structure.
an example of a functor is the "map" function that turns a list of objects into another list by applying a function to each of its elements.
In Haskell, and in some related pure functional language, Functor is a type class. A type belongs to a type class (or more technically, the type "is an instance of" the type class) when the type provides certain operations with certain expected behavior. A type T can belong to class Functor if it has certain collection-like behavior:
monad
a pure functional program has these characteristics: executed in no particular order, no side effects, stateless.
but sometimes we need to do these things.
monad is a construct that allows you to write imperative-style programs, to maintain state, and to do IO.

Tree traversal
1. in-order: left, root, right
2. pre-order: root, left, right (visit each node before its children)
3. post-order: left, right, root (visit each node after its children)
pre and post refer to when we visit the root
in-order: print from smallest to largest
post-order: depth-first search
storage order: pre-order

A type system is a syntactic method for enforcing levels of abstraction in programs.

Hindley-Milner (or “Damas-Milner”) is an algorithm for inferring value types based on use.
It literally formalizes the intuition that a type can be deduced by the functionality it supports.

type safety: does not allow the programmer to treat a value as a type to which it does not belong.
weak typing: use a value of one type as if it were a value of another type. example: C

8.8.8.8: google DNS server

techniques for solving problems:
Brute Force:
example: insertion sort
Divide and Conquer:
example: Mergesort and Quicksort
Greedy Programming:
Algorithms like Kruskal's and Prim's to find the minimum spanning tree of a graph and Dijkstra's to find the shortest path in a graph are classic examples of the greedy programming technique.
Dynamic Programming:
Problems like finding the longest common subsequence between two strings demonstrate one of the hallmarks of dynamic programming: overlapping subproblems that must be solved over and over again.

Dynamic programming:
Used for optimization problem.
solve problem by combining solutions to sub-problems.
sub-problems are not independent.
solve sub-problem in a bottom-up fashion.
store solution to a sub-problem
look up the solution when sub-problem is encountered again.
in order to use DP, the problem must have two attributes:
1. principle of optimality (optimal sub-structure):
in an optimal sequence of decisions, each sub-sequence must be optimal.
an optimal solution to the problem contains within it optimal solutions to sub-problems.
--> (best) the optimal solution to a problem consists of optimal solutions to sub-problems.
2. overlapping sub-problems:
there exist some places where we solve the same sub-problems more than once.
----
vs divide-and-conquer: cannot reuse solutions to sub-problems. non-overlapping sub-problems.
---
divide-and-conquer: break the problem into subproblems that are similar to the original
problem, solve the subproblems recursively, combine solutions to the subproblems to solve the original problem.
---
====
vs greedy algorithm:
greedy: make a local optimization. we just pick one solution.a special case of DP
--> make the choice that looks best at the moment. locally optimal choice.
top-down
-> follows local optimization.It tries to choose the solution which is locally optimum at that particular point of time and may not be the globally optimum solution.
DP: make a global optimization. pick the best solution from a collection of solutions
bottom-up
globally optimal choice
greedy algorithm: make the decision that seems most promising at any moment

hysteresis: the dependence of the output of a system not only on its current input, but also on its
history of past inputs. The dependence arises because the history affects the value of an internal state.
--> memory of previous events

Operations transform resource or data inputs into desired goods, services, or results, and create and deliver value to the customers.

diff between remainder and modulo
remainder:
1 % 6 = 1
-1 % 6 = -1
1 % -6 = 1
-1 % -6 = -1
modulo:
1 \\ 6 = 1
-1 \\ 6 = 5
1 \\ -6 = -5
-1 \\ -6 = -1
Conclusion:
if dividend and divisor have same sign, same answer
remainder: answer has same sign as dividend

detention: late fee for overdue containers
demurrage: fee for returning laden container too early or picking up laden container too late.

type: a label used by the type system to prove some property of a program's behavior.
a type system is a collection of rules that assign a property called a type to the various
construct, such as variables, expressions, functions or module.
Haskell:
type class is like Java interface?
a type is an instance of a type class?

Database normalization is the process of organizing the attributes and tables of a relational database to minimize data redundancy and dependency.

Finite Capacity Scheduling:
A scheduling method that matches resource requirements to a finite supply of available resources to develop a realistic production plan.
Fair-share scheduling is a scheduling strategy for computer operating systems in which the CPU usage is equally distributed among system users or groups,

event loop, message dispatcher, message loop, message pump, or run loop is a programming construct that waits for and dispatches events or messages in a program.

a callback is a piece of executable code that is passed as an argument to other code, which is expected to call back (execute) the argument at some convenient time.

JSONP: JSON with padding
JSON structure wrapped in a function
e.g. myfunc({"name": "cheok"});

In computer programming, a shim is a small library that transparently intercepts API calls and changes the arguments passed, handles the operation itself, or redirects the operation elsewhere.

A connection timeout occurs only upon starting the TCP connection. This usually happens if the remote machine does not answer. This means that the server has been shut down, you used the wrong IP/DNS name or the network connection to the server is down.
----
A socket timeout is dedicated to monitor the continuous incoming data flow. If the data flow is interrupted for the specified timeout the connection is regarded as stalled/broken.

CNAME stands for Canonical Name. CNAME records can be used to alias one name to another.

For example, if you have a server where you keep all of your documents online, it might normally be accessed through docs.example.com. You may also want to access it through documents.example.com. One way to make this possible is to add a CNAME record that points documents.example.com to docs.example.com. When someone visits documents.example.com they will see the exact same content as docs.example.com.

step into: the next statement displayed is the first statement of the called function
step over: the next statement displayed is the next statement of the current function
step out/return: execute the remaining lines of a function. the next statement displayed is the statement following the function call,
                 continue until the current function returns.

A TCP socket is an endpoint instance defined by an IP address and a port in the context of either a particular TCP connection or the listening state.
A port is a virtualisation identifier defining a service endpoint (as distinct from a service instance endpoint aka session identifier).
  like a virtualised endpoint.
A TCP socket is not a connection, it is the endpoint of a specific connection.
There can be concurrent connections to a service endpoint, because a connection is identified by both its local and remote endpoints, allowing traffic to be routed to a specific service instance.
There can only be one listener socket for a given address/port combination.
The combination of an IP address and a port is strictly known as an endpoint and is sometimes called a socket. protocol too?
A TCP connection is defined by two endpoints aka sockets.
In order to get a service you need a service number. This service number is called a port.

ARP request : Computer ‘A’ asks on the network, “who has this IP?”
ARP reply : All the other computers ignore the request except the computer which has the requested IP. This computer, lets say ‘B’ says, I have the requested
    IP address and here is my MAC address.
RARP request: This is more or less same as ARP request, the difference being that in this message a MAC address is broad-casted on network.
RARP reply : Same concept. Computer ‘B’ tells that the requested MAC is mine and here is my IP address.

HTTP keep-alive, or HTTP connection reuse, is the idea of using a single TCP connection to send and receive multiple HTTP requests/responses,
as opposed to opening a new connection for every single request/response pair. The newer HTTP/2 protocol uses the same idea and takes it
further to allow multiple concurrent requests/responses to be multiplexed over a single connection.

template engine: generate HTML from a template file and application data.
Web templates are simply text files that contain variables and control flow statements.
use static template files. at run time, the engine replaces variables in the
template with actual values.
--
templating language: the language is embedded within some other master document.

Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR): allocate IP address space on any address bit boundary

(telling the network what goes where) from the network forwarding plane (also called data plane)
(sending packets to specific destinations)
data plane: packet switching and forwarding
control plane: traffic shaping, routing, policy control.
---
SDN : allows you to control network devices from a centralized software platform (using
a standard protocol, such as OpenFlow).
network virtualization: create virtual replicas of hardware that are indistinguishable to servers.

connected graph: we can reach any vertex from any other vertex by following edges in either direction.
a tree is a connected graph with no cycles
spanning tree:
Let G be a connected graph. A spanning tree in G is a subgraph of G that includes all the vertices of G
and is also a tree. The edges of the tree are called branches.
minimum spanning tree of a weighted graph:
the spanning tree of G whose edges sum to minimum weight.

Tree is a special case/form of graph having no loops, no circuits and no self-loops.

framebuffer: The portion of memory reserved for holding the complete bit-mapped image that is sent to the monitor.
framebuffer: a part of video memory containing a current video frame,
framebuffer: memory containing a description of the current screen contents.
Typically the frame buffer is stored in the memory chips on the video adapter. In some instances, however, the
video chipset is integrated into the motherboard design, and the frame buffer is stored in general main memory.
scan-out/scanout buffer: the current framebuffer displayed on screen

depth-first search: start from a vertex and explore as far as possible along each edge before backtracking.
  --> follow a path all the way to the end
breadth-first search: start from a vertex and explores the neighbor nodes first, before moving to the next level neighbors
  --> explore each path one step at a time.

linker: takes one or more object files generated by a compiler and combines them into an executable file.
linker: resolve symbols as well.
linker performs address binding: assigning relative addresses.
loader: assign actual address. adjust the code and data in the program to reflect the assigned address.
An object file is a file containing object code, meaning relocatable format machine code that is usually not directly executable.
object code: what a computer compiler produces. Object code is a portion of machine code that has not yet been linked into a complete program. It is the machine code for one particular library or module that will make up the completed product. It may also contain placeholders or offsets, not found in the machine code of a completed program, that the linker will use to connect everything together. Whereas machine code is binary code that can be executed directly by the CPU, object code has the jumps partially parameterized so that a linker can fill them in.

There are three types of solutions that can occur in your body based on solute concentration: isotonic, hypotonic, and hypertonic.
An isotonic solution is one in which the concentration of solutes is the same both inside and outside of the cell.
A hypotonic solution is one in which the concentration of solutes is greater inside the cell than outside of it, and
a hypertonic solution is one where the concentration of solutes is greater outside the cell than inside it.

Frame: Any one function has a space in memory called a frame, holding info about the function, such as where to
return when finished and spaces for all the local variables.
When a function calls another function, the caller halts and a new function is added to the stack of frames. When a
function completes, its frame is popped off the stack and all local variables disappear.
--------
call stack: the chain of active functions that are currently executing.
----
stack frame: a data structure created on the stack to hold the data required for a function call.
--
The main function of the call stack is to keep track of the caller of a given routine, execute the
invoked routine while blocking the caller in the process, and returning control to the caller with a
return value (or nothing at all).

Union file systems allow files and directories of separate file systems, known as branches, to be
transparently overlaid, forming a single coherent file system.
----
A union mount is a way of mounting that allows several filesystems or directories to be
simultaneously mounted and visible through a single mount point, appearing to be one filesystem
Thus, any given directory (or "folder") in the resulting filesystem may contain files and
subdirectories from any or all of the underlying filesystems.  Union mounts are usually implemented
through union filesystems, such as UnionFS, aufs and OverlayFS. Generally, one of the constituent
directories or filesystems will be treated as read-write, while other directories or filesystems are
treated as read-only. If changes are written by applications to the union filesystem, they are
recorded in the writeable overlay. As such, union mounts are frequently used by Live CDs.

---
page cache: a portion of RAM set aside by the OS to cache file contents from disk, thereby
making subsequenct I/O faster.
----
The page cache caches pages of files to optimize file I/O. The buffer cache caches disk
blocks to optimize block I/O.
=======
page cache: physical pages in RAM, the contents of which correspond to physical blocks on a disk.
the pages originate from reads and writes of regular files, block device files, and memory-mapped files.

data buffer: a region of a physical memory storage used to temporarily store data while it is being
moved from one place to another Typically, the data is stored in a buffer as it is retrieved from an
input device or just before it is sent to an output device.  Buffers are typically used when there
is a difference between the rate at which data is received and the rate at which it can be
processed.
----
data buffer: a region of memory used as a temporary holding place when data is transferred between
2 devices that are not operating at the same speed.

communicating sequential processes: a program is a parallel composition of processes that have no
shared state; the processes communicate and synchronize using channels.

In computer science, string interning is a method of storing only one copy of each distinct string
value, which must be immutable. In Smalltalk, symbol is like an interned string

EAFP (easier to ask for forgiveness than permission)
assume the existence of keys/attributes and catches exceptions if the assumption is false.
LBYL (look before you leap): tests for pre-conditions before making calls or lookups
In a multi-threaded environment, the LBYL approach can risk introducing a race condition between
“the looking” and “the leaping”. For example, the code, if key in mapping: return mapping[key] can
fail if another thread removes key from mapping after the test, but before the lookup. This issue
can be solved with locks or by using the EAFP approach.

test data:
#1. production data: not a good idea
#2. de-identified data: removing sensitive areas of data in order not to reveal the source.
#3. synthetic/artificial data

call by value: pass arguments to function as copies. the variable in the caller is unchanged when

Static program analysis is the analysis of computer software that is performed without actually
executing programs (analysis performed on executing programs is known as dynamic analysis

After a home buyer secures a loan, the lender will typically protect the loan with either a deed of
trust or a mortgage. Both documents place a lien on the house, which allows the lender to sell the
property if the borrower can’t meet the terms laid out. But, importantly, when a deed of trust is
used, the lender does not have to go through the court system to sell the home.
California uses deed of trust.
---
For home loans backed by a deed of trust, neither the borrower nor the lender holds the title to the
property. The deed of trust brings in a third party to hold the title. This party is the
trustee. The trustee might be a bank, a lawyer or some other entity, but it must be a neutral
party. When the borrower has repaid the loan, the lender directs the trustee to release the title to
the borrower, who now owns the house free and clear.
---
Home loans backed by a deed of trust are trusts.
---
the main purpose of the grant deed is to transfer property title from one person to another, such as
from a seller to a buyer. A grant deed is written evidence that you actually own your
property. Additionally, the grant deed provides title guarantees to the new owner.

127.0.0.1
127.0.0.1 is the loopback address (also known as localhost).
0.0.0.0
In the context of a route entry, it usually means the default route.
In the context of servers, 0.0.0.0 means all IPv4 addresses on the local machine. If a host has two
IP addresses, 192.168.1.1 and 10.1.2.1, and a server running on the host listens on 0.0.0.0, it will
be reachable at both of those IPs.


advice on reading nonfiction, with a few additions of my own:

1. Start with the author. Who wrote the book? Read his or her bio. If you can find a brief interview
or article online about the author, read that quickly. It will give you a sense of the person’s bias
and perspective.

2. Read the title, the subtitle, the front flap, and the table of contents. What’s the big-picture
argument of the book? How is that argument laid out? By now, you could probably describe the main
idea of the book to someone who hasn’t read it.

3. Read the introduction and the conclusion. The author makes their case in the opening and closing
argument of the book. Read these two sections word for word but quickly. You already have a general
sense of where the author is going, and these sections will tell you how they plan to get there
(introduction) and what they hope you got out of it (conclusion).

4. Read/skim each chapter. Read the title and anywhere from the first few paragraphs to the first
few pages of the chapter to figure out how the author is using this chapter and where it fits into
the argument of the book. Then skim through the headings and subheadings (if there are any) to get a
feel for the flow. Read the first sentence of each paragraph and the last. If you get the meaning,
move on. Otherwise, you may want to read the whole paragraph. Once you’ve gotten an understanding of
the chapter, you may be able to skim over whole pages, as the argument may be clear to you and also
may repeat itself.

5. End with the table of contents again. Once you’ve finished the book, return to the table of
contents and summarize it in your head. Take a few moments to relive the flow of the book, the
arguments you considered, the stories you remember, the journey you went on with the author.

--virtualization--

LinuX Containers (LXC) is an operating system-level virtualization method for running multiple
isolated Linux systems (containers) on a single control host (LXC host). It does not provide a
virtual machine, but rather provides a virtual environment that has its own CPU, memory, block I/O,
network, etc. space. This is provided by cgroups features in Linux kernel on LXC host. It is similar
to a chroot, but offers much more isolation.

The main difference between the KVM virtualization and Linux Containers is that virtual machines
require a separate kernel instance to run on, while containers can be deployed from the host
operating system.

KVM is a hypervisor and LXC is OS virtualization. OS virtualization does not have the hypervisor
layer. There are limitations though; you're limited to the host's kernel, you cannot install
different distributions (LXC allows for different distributions using templates). Nothing is
emulated with OS virtualization. Performance is better as the containers share the same kernel. And,
personally containers are just easier to use and manage. cgroups are used in both KVM and LXC; it's
not a unique feature to any virtualization technology.

KVM virtualization lets you boot full operating systems of different kinds, even non-Linux systems.
Running separate kernel instances generally means better separation and security. If one of the
kernels terminates unexpectedly, it does not disable the whole system. On the other hand, this
isolation makes it harder for virtual machines to communicate with the rest of the system.  Guest
virtual machine is isolated from host changes, which lets you run different versions of the same
application on the host and virtual machine.

hypervisor: a specialized operating system designed to run/manage virtual machines.
---
hypervisor: a piece of software that emulates hardware and manages virtual machines.
a hypervisor works by having the host operating system emulate machine hardware and then bringing up
other virtual machines (VMs) as guest operating systems on top of that hardware. This means that the
communication between guest and host operating systems must follow a hardware paradigm (anything
that can be done in hardware can be done by the host to the guest).

On the other hand, container virtualization (shown in figure 2), is virtualization at the operating
system level, instead of the hardware level. So each of the guest operating systems shares the same
kernel, and sometimes parts of the operating system, with the host. This enhanced sharing gives
containers a great advantage in that they are leaner and smaller than hypervisor guests, simply
because they're sharing much more of the pieces with the host. It also gives them the huge advantage
that the guest kernel is much more efficient about sharing resources between containers, because it
sees the containers as simply resources to be managed.
---
container: an isolated user-space environment

An example: Container 1 and Container 2 open the same file, the host kernel opens the file and puts
pages from it into the kernel page cache. These pages are then handed out to Container 1 and
Container 2 as they are needed, and if both want to read the same position, they both get the same
page. In the case of VM1 and VM2 doing the same thing, the host opens the file (creating pages in
the host page cache) but then each of the kernels in VM1 and VM2 does the same thing, meaning if VM1
and VM2 read the same file, there are now three separate pages (one in the page caches of the host,
VM1 and VM2 kernels) simply because they cannot share the page in the same way a container can.

Summary: KVM is a Hypervisor based on emulating virtual hardware. Containers, on the other hand, are
based on shared operating systems and is skinnier.

When you run a secondary OS on top of a primary OS, the secondary OS is called a virtual machine.
each instance of a guest operating system is called a virtual machine.

Paravirtualization is a technique in which the hypervisor provides an API and the OS of the
guest virtual machine calls that API, requiring OS modifications.

hardware-assisted virtualization is a platform virtualization approach
that enables efficient full virtualization using help from hardware
capabilities, primarily from the host processors. Full virtualization
is used to simulate a complete hardware environment, or virtual
machine, in which an unmodified guest operating system (using the same
instruction set as the host machine) executes in complete isolation.

virtualization: the separation of a service request from the physical delivery of that request.
Normally, the OS is coupled to the hardware.
virtualization decouples the OS from the hardware.
virtualization layer: between hardware and OS.
hosted architecture: runs the virtualization layer as an application on top of an OS.
hypervisor architecture: runs the virtualization layer directly on top of hardware.
the hypervisor manages virtual machine monitors that host virtual machines.
VMM (virtual machine monitor) notifies the host when the VM tries to access the hardware.
---
virtualization: the process of hiding the hardware in a way that makes it usable and shareable by
multiple OS.

technique #1: full virtualization with binary translation (trap and emulate)
technique #2: paravirtualization
technique #3: hardware-assited virtualization

x86 architecture: 4 levels of privilege (ring 0-3). OS runs in ring 0.
full virtualization with binary translation: hypervisor runs in ring 0. guest OS runs in ring 1.
Some x86 instructions work only in Ring 0. Those instructions are trapped by VMM, which emulates them.
hardware-assisted virtualization: a new privilege level: ring -1. hypervisor runs in ring -1, so the
guest OS runs in ring 0

virtualization requirements:
#1 equivalence: a program running in a VM cannot tell it is running in a VM.
#2 resource control: the VMM must be in complete control of the virtualized resouces.
#3 efficiency: all innocuous instructions are executed by the hardware directly

An OS virtualizes the hardware to processes so that each process thinks it has exclusive use of the
hardware.
A hypervisor virtualizes the hardware to guest OSes so that each guest OS thinks it has exclusive use
of the hardware. a mini OS that abstracts the hardware from its guests.

hypervisor: an operating system for other operating systems.
hypervisors do for operating systems what operating systems do for processes.
They provide isolated virtual hardware platform for execution that in turn provide the illusion
of full access to the underlying machine.

ASLR: address space layout randomization
is a memory-protection process for operating systems (OSes) that guards against buffer-overflow
attacks by randomizing the location where system executables are loaded into memory.

systems programming: produce software that provides services to other software
application programming: produce software that provides services to users

The EIP register always contains the address of the next instruction to be executed.  You cannot
directly access or change the instruction pointer.  However, instructions that control program flow,
such as calls, jumps, loops, and interrupts, automatically change the instruction pointer.
In x86_64, the instruction pointer is called RIP
The ESP register serves as an indirect memory operand pointing to the top of the stack at any time.

tf–idf, short for term frequency–inverse document frequency, is a numerical statistic that is
intended to reflect how important a word is to a document in a collection. It is often used as a
weighting factor in information retrieval and text mining. The tf-idf value increases proportionally
to the number of times a word appears in the document, but is offset by the frequency of the word in
the corpus, which helps to adjust for the fact that some words appear more frequently in general.
---
tf-idf: the idea is to give high weight to a term that appears frequently in one document, but
not in many documents in the corpus. If a word appears frequently in one document, but not in many
documents, it is likely to hightly descriptive of the contents of that document.

IP forwarding should be enabled when you want the system to act as a router, that is transfer IP
packets from one network to another.
IP forwarding involves transferring packets between network interfaces. That means
the computer should have at least 2 network interface cards.
===
A router has multiple network interfaces. If traffic comes in on one interface that matches a subnet
of another network interface, a router then forwards that traffic to the other network interface.
===
So, let's say you have two NICs, one (NIC 1) is at address 192.168.2.1/24, and the other (NIC 2) is
192.168.3.1/24. If forwarding is enabled, and a packet comes in on NIC 1 with a "destination
address" of 192.168.3.8, the router will resend that packet out of the NIC 2.

-- hyper-threading: intel's proprietary multi-threading implementation
A single physical CPU core with hyper-threading appears as two logical CPUs to an operating
system. The CPU is still a single CPU, so it’s “cheating” a bit — while the operating system sees
two CPUs for each core, the actual CPU hardware only has a single set of execution resources for
each core. The CPU pretends it has more cores than it does, and it uses its own logic to speed up
program execution. Hyper-threading allows the two logical CPU cores to share physical execution
resources.
=====
Logical cores are the number of physical cores times the number of threads that can run on each core
through the use of hyperthreading. for example, my 4-core processor runs two threads per core, so I
have 8 logical processors.
=====
CPU(s):                8
Thread(s) per core:    2

SMP (symmetric multiprocessing) is the processing of programs by multiple processors that share a
common operating system and memory. In symmetric (or "tightly coupled") multiprocessing, the
processors share memory and the I/O bus or data path. A single copy of the operating system is in
charge of all the processors. SMP, also known as a "shared everything" system, does not usually
exceed 16 processors.
====
A symmetric multiprocessor system (SMP) is a multiprocessor system with centralized shared memory
called main memory (MM) operating under a single operating system with two or more homogeneous
processors
=====
SMP: a multiprocessor system that shares a common OS and memory. As the number of cores increases,
the memory bus is under heavy contention, thus limiting scalability. NUMA is one way of reducing
memory bus contention. This is accomplished by having several memory busses and only a small number
of CPUs on each of those busses.
-----
NUMA (non-uniform memory access) is a method of configuring a cluster of microprocessor in a
multiprocessing system so that they can share memory locally, improving performance and the ability
of the system to be expanded. NUMA is used in a symmetric multiprocessing ( SMP ) system. An SMP
system is a "tightly-coupled," "share everything" system in which multiple processors working under
a single operating system access each other's memory over a common bus or "interconnect"
path. Ordinarily, a limitation of SMP is that as microprocessors are added, the shared bus or data
path get overloaded and becomes a performance bottleneck. NUMA adds an intermediate level of memory
shared among a few microprocessors so that all data accesses don't have to travel on the main bus.
-----
better:
means that it will take longer to access some regions of memory than others. this is due to the
fact that some regions of memory are on physically different buses from other regions.
NUMA was designed to overcome the scalability limits of the SMP architexture.
With SMP, all memory access are posted to the same shared memory bus.
NUMA limits the number of CPUs on any one memory bus and connects the various nodes by means
of a high-speed interconnect.
NUMA node: a block of memory and CPU, I/O that are physically on the same bus.
--> NUMA is an architecture where all the cores are divided into clusters (called nodes). The nodes
are linked via high-speed interconnect. Each node contains CPUs and memory, much like a small
SMP system.
---> NUMA is a hardware layout where CPU and memory do not share a common bus.
However, an advanced memory controller allows a node to use memory on all other nodes,
creating a single system image. When a processor accesses memory that does not lie within its own
node (remote memory), the data must be transferred over the NUMA connection, which is slower than
accessing local memory. Memory access times are not uniform and depend on the location of the memory
and the node from which it is accessed, as the technology’s name implies.
=== NUMA effects: CPUs in a node will have lower memory latency when accessing memory in the same
node.

resilience and fault tolerance
the ability of a system to continue functioning and providing services in the presence
of network disruptions and hardware failures.

docker vs LXC
In the early days of the Docker project,  LXC was used as its default execution driver,
so they decided to write a new open source execution driver, libcontainer.
In conclusion, "LXC is a userspace interface for the Linux kernel containment features.
Through a powerful API and simple tools, it lets Linux users easily create and manage
system or application containers.", while docker is a growing and evolving platform that
provides an standard runtime environment for containers that used to use LXC.

CPU flame graph:
-> each box represents a function in the stack (stack frame)
-> the y-axis shows stack depth, the top box is the function on CPU. the function beneath
a function is its parent.
-> The x-axis spans the sample population. It does not show the passing of time from left to right,
as most graphs do. The left to right ordering has no meaning (it's sorted alphabetically to maximize
frame merging).
-> The width of the box shows the total time it was on-CPU or part of an ancestry that was on-CPU
   (based on sample count). Functions with wide boxes may consume more CPU per execution than those
   with narrow boxes, or, they may simply be called more often. The call count is not shown (or
   known via sampling).

-> The sample count can exceed elapsed time if multiple threads were running and sampled concurrently.

shellcode:
In computer security, a shellcode is a small piece of code used as the payload in the exploitation
of a software vulnerability. It is called "shellcode" because it typically starts a command shell
from which the attacker can control the compromised machine,

==================
Orthogonality is the property that means "Changing A does not change B". An example of an orthogonal
system would be a radio, where changing the station does not change the volume and vice-versa.
-----
A non-orthogonal system would be like a helicopter where changing the speed can change the direction.
----
In programming languages this means that when you execute an instruction, nothing but that
instruction happens (very important for debugging).
-----
In computer engineering, an orthogonal instruction set is an instruction set architecture where all
instruction types can use all addressing modes. It is "orthogonal" in the sense that the instruction
type and the addressing mode vary independently.
-----
Orthogonality is one of the most important properties that can help make even complex designs
compact. In a purely orthogonal design, operations do not have side effects; each action (whether
it's an API call, a macro invocation, or a language operation) changes just one thing without
affecting others. There is one and only one way to change each property of whatever system you are
controlling.

BSS (Block Started by Symbol) segment:
used by many compilers and linkers for a part of the data segment containing statically-allocated
variables represented solely by zero-valued bits initially.
Contains static variable.

ATAPI is actually a protocol allowing the ATA interface to carry SCSI commands and responses;
therefore, all ATAPI devices are actually "speaking SCSI" other than at the electrical interface.

CPU profiling:
When CPU profiling is enabled, the runtime will interrupt itself every 10ms and record the stack
trace of the currently running goroutines.  Once the profile is saved to disk, we can analyse it to
determine the hottest code paths.  The more times a function appears in the profile, the more time
that code path is taking as a percentage of the total runtime.

Memory profiling records the stack trace when a heap allocation is made.

self-hosting compiler: writing a compiler in the language in compiles. for example, writing
a C compiler in C. bootstrapping compiler.
the first such compiler for a language must be either hand written machine code or compiled by a
compiler written in another language, or compiled by running the compiler in an interpreter.

early machines required operators to enter their program by flipping a series of switches up/down
to represent 1/0 then hit a "process" button to order the machine to execute the instruction present
on the switches. Programming started with binary code. Assemblers were written with binary
code. FORTRAN was written in assembly at first then later it could be written in FORTRAN. The first
C compiler, for a later example, was first written with assembly then later iterations were written
in C itself.
--bootstrapping compiler
The idea is to write a very simple compiler directly in machine code, use it to write a more
sophisticated compiler, use the second one to build a third one and so on until you can have a full
featured compiler.

heap data structure: a tree
each element is larger than its two children
heap data structure is a maximally efficient implementation of a priority queue.
generalized heap property:
1. each node is larger than or equal to its children (called max heap)
2. each node is smaller than or equal to its children (called min heap)
--> allow access to min/max element in constant time.
--> heaps are commonly implemented with an array
====
a binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are
referred to as the left child and the right child.
---
full binary tree: every node has either 0 or 2 children
complete binary tree: all levels of the tree, except possibly the last one, are completely filled.
If the last level is not filled, the nodes of that level are filled from left to right.
====
binary tree implemented with an array:
root is at index 0
if a node has index i, the left child is at (2i+1) and right child is at (2i+2), its
parent is at floor((i-1)/2)
====
heap: a pool of memory from which dynamically allocated objects are allocated.

A page, memory page, or virtual page is a fixed-length contiguous block of virtual memory, described

telemetry: the transmission of data from remote sources to receiving stations for recording and analysis.

pipelining (computer architecture):
a pipeline is the continuous and somewhat overlapped movement of instruction to the processor or in
the arithmetic steps taken by the processor to perform an instruction. Pipelining is the use of a
pipeline. Without a pipeline, a computer processor gets the first instruction from memory, performs
the operation it calls for, and then goes to get the next instruction from memory, and so
forth. While fetching (getting) the instruction, the arithmetic part of the processor is idle. It
must wait until it gets the next instruction. With pipelining, the computer architecture allows the
next instructions to be fetched while the processor is performing arithmetic operations, holding
them in a buffer close to the processor until each instruction operation can be performed. The
staging of instruction fetching is continuous. The result is an increase in the number of
instructions that can be performed during a given time period.
===================================
sequence: fetch instruction, decode instruction, execute instruction, memory access, write back result

collections with a collective meaning.
Parser determines whether or not the stream of words consists of valid sentences in the source language.

logging vs instrumentation:
only log actionable information. stuff consumed by humans or structured data consumed by machines.
instrumentation: capture meaningful info. RED: request rate (count), Error rate, duration of requests

logs should be treated as event streams. no beginning or end, but an ongoing collection of events.
should not write to any log file. should write to stdout.

journaling filesystem: the filesystem keeps a record of file transactions so that the files
can be recovered in the event of hard drive crash. like a transaction log.
example: ext3

WebDAV (Web-based Distributed Authoring and Versioning) lets you edit and manage files
stored on remote file servers.

DVD-R: only be written to in one layer on the discs surface. cheaper
DVD+R: can be written to in multiple layers, giving them slightly better and more disc storage than the
“minus“ format. Because of this additional capacity, they are slightly more expensive than “minus“
discs.

PXE (Preboot Execution Environment): network boot. booting a computer from a network instead of
a local drive.

stack-based vs register-based virtual machine:
=======
stack-based: operands and results are stored on stack (arithmetic operation)
benefits include simplicity of VM implementation, ease of writing a compiler back-end (most VMs are
originally designed to host a single language) and code density (i.e., executables for stack
architectures are invariably smaller than executables for register architectures).
=====
register-based: operands and results are stored in register (arithmetic operation)

things to do when things go negative:

page fault: When a process attempts to access a virtual address that is not currently in memory.

demand paging:  only loading virtual pages into memory as they are accessed.

Memory mapping : the contents of a file are linked directly into the virtual address space of a
process.
This linking of an image into a processes virtual address space is known as memory mapping.
memory mapping (mmap system call): mapping a file into the virtual address space of a process.
This means there is a one-to-one correspondence between a memory address and a word in the file.

Kernel preemption is a method used mainly in monolithic and hybrid kernels where all or most device
drivers are run in kernel space, whereby the scheduler is permitted to forcibly perform a context
switch (i.e. preemptively schedule; on behalf of a runnable and higher priority process) on a driver
or other part of the kernel during its execution,
==========
Linux kernel is preemptive: processes running in kernel mode can be preempted.

backward compatible:
Compatible with earlier models or versions of the same product. A new version of a program is said
to be backward compatible if it can use files and data created with an older version of the same
program. A computer is said to be backward compatible if it can runthe same software as the previous
model of the computer.
==============================
upward compatible:
Refers to software that runs not only on the computer for which it was designed, but also on newer
and more powerful models. For example, a program designed to run on an Intel 386 microprocessor,
which also runs on a Pentium, is upward compatible. Upward compatibility is important because it
means you can move to a newer, larger, and more sophisticated computer without converting your data.

Reactive programming is programming with asynchronous data streams
====
Reactive programming (RP) is based on data flows and the propagation of change, with the underlying
execution model of a programming language automatically propagating changes through the data
flow. With the popularity of event-driven, scalable, and interactive architectures both on the
server and the client, the concept of “reactiveness” is increasingly gaining attention
======
One kind of dataflow programming is reactive programming. When this style of programming is used in
a functional language, it's called functional reactive programming. ??
=========
dataflow programming: example: spreadsheets
=======
dataflow programming is the same as reactive programming??
dataflow programming: code executes when the data it depends on becomes available.
-----
reactive programming: programs automatically react to the propagation of changes.
reactive programming: components react to changes in data that are propagated to them rather than use imperative wiring
reactive programming: non-blocking, event-driven architecture
---

API for composing asynchronous programs: ReactiveX

binary compatibility: can run the same executable code
-----
java binary compatibility means that when you change your class, you do not need to recompile classes that use it.

containers: self-contained isolated execution enviroments that share the kernel with the host OS.

memory addressing:
logical address: consists of a segment and an offset
linear address: the virtual address
physical address: points to physical memory
=========
logical address-> segmentation unit -> linear address-> paging unit -> physical address

hard disk access time = seek time + rotational latency

page frame: a block of RAM in main memory
page: a block of data, which may be stored in a page frame or on disk
each page corresponds to several blocks of a regular file or a block device file.
reading a file is page-based: the kernel always transfer whole pages of data at once.
===
a memory region can be associated with some portion of either a regular file in a disk-based
filesystem or a block device file.
this means that an access to a byte within a page of the memory region is translated by
the kernel into an operation on the corresponding byte of the file. this is called memory mapping.

object file cannot be executed because it does not contain the linear address that corresponds
to all references that are defined outside the source file (such as functions in libraries or other
source files).
the assigning, or resolution, of such addresses is performed by the linker.

execution tracing: allow a program to monitor the execution of another program.

malleolus: the bony prominence on each side of the ankle.
=========
Each leg is supported by two bones, the tibia on the inner side (medial) of the leg and the fibula
on the outer side (lateral) of the leg. The medial malleolus is the prominence on the inner side of
the ankle, formed by the lower end of the tibia. The lateral malleolus is the prominence on the
outer side of the ankle, formed by the lower end of the fibula.

Memory fragmentation is when most of your memory is allocated in a large number of non-contiguous
blocks, or chunks - leaving a good percentage of your total memory unallocated, but unusable for
most typical scenarios.

virtual memory: the use of hard disk space to simulate additional main memory

leg bones:
tibia : inner (medial), larger and stronger

blood: blood cells suspended in blood plasma
blood plasma: It is mostly water (up to 95% by volume), and contains dissolved proteins (6–8%) (i.e.—serum
albumins, globulins, and fibrinogen), glucose, clotting factors, electrolytes (Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+,
HCO3−, Cl−, etc.), hormones, and carbon dioxide (plasma being the main medium for excretory product
transportation).
======
serum:
the blood plasma not including the fibrinogens. Serum includes all proteins not used in blood
clotting (coagulation) and all the electrolytes, antibodies, antigens, hormones, and any exogenous
substances (e.g., drugs and microorganisms).

third-spacing:
In a healthy adult, nearly all fluid is contained in the intracellular, intravascular, or
interstitial spaces, with the intracellular space holding about two-thirds of total body
water. Normally, fluid moves freely between these three spaces to maintain fluid balance
===========
Third-spacing occurs when too much fluid moves from the intravascular space (blood vessels) into the
interstitial or "third" space-the nonfunctional area between cells. This can cause potentially
serious problems such as edema, reduced cardiac output, and hypotension.
===========
Third spacing is the unusual accumulation of fluid in a transcellular space.

ascites: An abnormal accumulation of serous fluid in the abdominal cavity.

Interstitial fluid or tissue fluid is a solution that bathes and surrounds the tissue cells of
multicellular animals. It is the main component of the extracellular fluid, which also includes
plasma and transcellular fluid.

Interstitial spaces
Spaces within body tissues that are outside the blood vessels. Interstitial spaces are also known as
interstitial compartments.

transcellular compartment:
consists of those spaces in the body where fluid does not normally collect in larger amounts,
or where any significant fluid collection is physiologically nonfunctional. Examples of
transcellular spaces include the eye, the central nervous system, the peritoneal and pleural
cavities, and the joint capsules. A small amount of fluid, called transcellular fluid, does exist
normally in such spaces. For example, the aqueous humor, the vitreous humor, the cerebrospinal
fluid, the serous fluid produced by the serous membranes, and the synovial fluid produced by the
synovial membranes are all transcellular fluids.

extracellular compartments: interstitial, intravascular, transcellular

A blockchain is a public ledger of all Bitcoin transactions that have ever been executed. It is
constantly growing as 'completed' blocks are added to it with a new set of recordings. The blocks

second-class lever: load is between fulcrum and effort: wheelbarrow: effort is always less than the load
third-class lever: effort is between fulcrum and load:  effort is always greater than the load
===
A hammer acts as a third-class lever when it is used to drive in a nail: the fulcrum is the wrist,
the effort is applied through the hand, and the load is the resistance of the wood.  Another example
of a third-class lever is the human forearm: the fulcrum is the elbow, the effort is applied by the
biceps muscle, and the load is in the hand.

a typing rule or type constructor is
covariant if it preserves the ordering of types (eg. list of Cat is a subtype of list of Animal)
contravariant: it it reverses the ordering
invariant: if none applies
====
read-only data types (sources) can be covariant, write-only date types (sinks) can be contravariant.
mutable data types which act as both sources and sinks should be invariant.
====

In computer programming, orthogonality in a programming language means that a relatively small set
of primitive constructs can be combined in a relatively small number of ways to build the control
and data structures of the language.

Proper error handling means that servers continue operation after non-fatal errors instead of

regular expression: a pattern matching notation. a notation for describing patterns of text.

concurrent program: has multiple logical threads of control. these threads may or may not run in parallel.
parallel program: executing different parts simultaneously. may or may not have multiple threads of control.
concurrency: an aspect of the problem domain
parallelism: an aspect of the solution domain.
concurrency: about dealing with lots of things at once.
parallelism: about doing lots of things at once.
concurrent programs are often nondeterminisitc. they give different results depending on the timing of events.
concurrency: managing multiple tasks at the same time
parallelism: executing multiple tasks at the same time
parallelism is a subclass of concurrency. before you execute multiple tasks simultaneously, you first
have to manage them.
---
distributed computing is a special version of parallel computing where the processors
are in different computers and tasks are distributed to computers over a network.
---
concurrent programming and parallel programming refer to techniques for decomposing a task
into subtasks that can execute in parallel and managing the risks that arise when your
program executes more than one task at the same time.

Amdahl's law is that, in a program with parallel processing , a relatively few instructions that
have to be performed in sequence will have a limiting factor on program speedup such that adding
more processors may not make the program run faster.
====
Amdahl's Law is a law governing the speedup of using parallel processors on a problem, versus using
only one serial processor
===
Amdahl's law is often used in parallel computing to predict the theoretical speedup when using
multiple processors. the speedup is limited by the time needed for sequential processing.
===
Amdahl's law: the more often, or the longer, that threads have to wait for one another, the less
the system is able to benefit from adding more hardware to it.
===
Amdahl's law: shows that the theoretical speedup of a system is limited by the serial parts, which
means that the system can experience diminishing returns as new resources are added.

work stealing:
In parallel computing, work stealing is a scheduling strategy for multithreaded computer programs.
====
In a work stealing scheduler, each processor in a computer system has a queue of work items
(computational tasks, threads) to perform. Each work item consists of a series of instructions, to
be executed sequentially, but in the course of its execution, a work item may also spawn new work
items that can feasibly be executed in parallel with its other work. These new items are initially
put on the queue of the processor executing the work item. When a processor runs out of work, it
looks at the queues of other processors and "steals" their work items. In effect, work stealing
distributes the scheduling work over idle processors, and as long as all processors have work to do,
no scheduling overhead occurs.
--
let's say you have multiple queues of work items and a thread is assigned to each queue.
When one thread finishes its work items and has nothing to do, it steals work items from
other queues.
===
work-stealing: reassigning task from a busy thread to an idle thread.

ignition coil: a transformer. generate high-voltage current
distributor: distributes high-voltage current to spark plug. the current jump across the arc
to create a spark, which ignites the air-fuel mixture.
camshaft: have the job of opening the valves that let air into and exhaust out of the engine
The camshaft uses rotating lobes, called cams, that push against the valves to open them. Springs on
the valves return them to their closed position.

The main benefit of dual overhead cams is that they allow an engine to have four valves per
cylinder. Each camshaft operates two of the valves, one camshaft handles the intake valves, and one
handles the exhaust valves.

MVCC: Multiversion concurrency control, is a concurrency control method commonly used by database
management systems to provide concurrent access to the database and in programming languages to
implement transactional memory.

An affordance is the possibility of an action on an object or environment.
--
Affordances are clues about how an object should be used, typically provided by the object itself or
its context. For example, even if you've never seen a coffee mug before, its use is fairly natural.

separating identity from state:
identity: fuel level in your car
state: the value that represents the fuel level at a particular time. the state associated
  with an identity is really a sequence of values over time.

persistent data structure: preserves the previous values when it is modified.

actor programming: retain mutable state but avoid sharing it.
actor : like an object. communicate by sending messages.
actor messages are sent asynchronously to mailboxes

actor program: consists of independent, concurrently executing entities (called actors)
that communicate by sending each other messages.
actor : the medium of communication is tightly coupled to the unit of execution. each actor
has exactly one mailbox. asynchronous
Communicating sequential process (CSP): similar to actors, except CSP focuses on the
channels over which messages are sent.
a channel is a thread-safe queue.
by default, channels are synchronous (unbuffered), more common.
alternatively, channels can be buffered.
how to handle full buffer: (1) block (2) discard the oldest value (sliding buffer)
(3) discard the most recently written value (dropping buffer)
when using unbuffered channels, the result is very similar to a dataflow program.

GPGPU: general-purpose computing on the GPU

Open Computing Language (OpenCL) is a framework for writing programs that execute across
heterogeneous platforms consisting of central processing units (CPUs), graphics processing units
(GPUs), digital signal processors (DSPs), field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and other
processors or hardware accelerators.

The open standard for parallel programming of heterogeneous systems

Lambda architecture is a data-processing architecture designed to handle massive quantities of data
by taking advantage of both batch- and stream-processing methods. This approach to architecture
attempts to balance latency, throughput, and fault-tolerance by using batch processing to provide
comprehensive and accurate views of batch data, while simultaneously using real-time stream
processing to provide views of online data. The two view outputs may be joined before presentation.

Stream processing : refers to a method of continuous computation that happens as
data is flowing through the system.

Memcached (pronunciation: mem-cash-dee) is a general-purpose distributed memory caching system. It
is often used to speed up dynamic database-driven websites by caching data and objects in RAM to
reduce the number of times an external data source (such as a database or API) must be read.
--
Memcached is a volatile in-memory key/value store. Redis can act like one (and do that job as well
as memcached), but it is a data structure server.
--
Both Memcached and Redis serve as in-memory, key-value data stores, although Redis is more
accurately described as a data structure store

an opcode (abbreviated from operation code, also known as instruction syllable or opstrings.) is the
portion of a machine language instruction that specifies the operation to be performed. Beside the
opcode itself, most instructions also specify the data they will process, in the form of operands.

a mnemonic is a symbolic name for a single executable machine language instruction (an opcode),

Scala traits (as interfaces). can have both abstract and concrete methods. a class
can implement multiple traits.

Continuation-passing style, or CPS more shortly, is a style of programming sometimes employed in
FunctionalProgramming languages. Its idea is, instead of having a function return a value, let a
function take as an argument another function (the continuation) to which the result is given as an
argument.
====
example in Scheme:
 (define myfunc (lambda (x) (do-something-with x)))
 (define myfunc_CPS (lambda (x k) (k (do-something-with x))))

rolling release or rolling update development model refers to a continually developing software
system; as opposed to a standard release development model which uses software versions that
must be reinstalled over the previous version.
--
rolling release: the concept of frequently delivering updates to applications, as opposed to
the standard point release.

In web development, a polyfill is code that implements a feature on web browsers that do not support
the feature. Most often, it refers to a JavaScript library that implements an HTML5 web standard,

in software engineering, a compatibility layer is an interface that allows binaries for a legacy or
foreign system to run on a host system. This translates system calls for the foreign system into
native system calls for the host system. With some libraries for the foreign system, this will often
be sufficient to run foreign binaries on the host system.

==shim
In computer programming, a shim is a small library that transparently intercepts API calls and
changes the arguments passed, handles the operation itself, or redirects the operation
elsewhere.
Shims can be used to support an old API in a newer environment, or a new API in an
older environment. Shims can also be used for running programs on different software platforms than
they were developed for.
=====
Shims for older APIs typically come about when the behavior of an API changes, thereby causing
compatibility issues for older applications which still rely on the older functionality; in such
cases, the older API can still be supported by a thin compatibility layer on top of the newer
code. Shims for newer APIs are defined as: "a shim is a library that brings a new API to an older
environment, using only the means of that environment."

GPL: free refers to freedom
===
The GPL does not require you to release your modified version, or any part of it. You are free to
make modifications and use them privately, without ever releasing them. This applies to
organizations (including companies), too; an organization can make a modified version and use it
internally without ever releasing it outside the organization. But if you release the modified
version to the public in some way, the GPL requires you to make the modified source code available
to the program's users, under the GPL. Thus, the GPL gives permission to release the modified
program in certain ways, and not in other ways; but the decision of whether to release it is up to
you.
===
The GPL gives him permission to make and redistribute copies of the program if and when he chooses
to do so. He also has the right not to redistribute the program, when that is what he chooses.
===
Even once a developer has distributed a binary or executable copy of their program, they may not
need to share their source code unless the person receiving the program specifically asks for a copy
of the source code.

escape analysis is a method for determining the dynamic scope of pointers - where in the program a
pointer can be accessed. It is related to pointer analysis and shape analysis.
===
If a subroutine allocates an object and returns a pointer to it, the object can be accessed from
undetermined places in the program — the pointer has "escaped". Pointers can also escape if they are
stored in global variables or other data structures that, in turn, escape the current procedure.
Escape analysis determines all the places where a pointer can be stored and whether the lifetime of
the pointer can be proven to be restricted only to the current procedure and/or thread.

mark-and-sweep: start from a set of known live objects, walk through the tree of references from the live
objects, and mark as live any objects found en route. everything left is garbage.

TDD: write a test before writing the code, and the refactor the implementation as needed.

levels of TDD testing:
unit: verify code in a class. eg. test method in BigDecimal class
integration: verify interaction between classes.
system: verify a running system.
system integration: verify a running system, including third-party components

test double:
1. dummy: an object that is passed around but never used.
2. stub: an object that always return the same canned response
3. fake: an actual working implementation (not of production quality) that can replace
   the real implementation.
4. mock: an object that represents a series of expectations and provides canned response
   you tell it the sequence of calls to expect and how it should respond to each one.
--
Mock objects are a special type of objects used to replace real objects for testing. They belong to
the well-known testing objects called "test doubles," Mocks are what we are talking about here:
objects pre-programmed with expectations which form a specification of the calls they are expected
to receive.
--
One core aspect in unit testing is the fact that you want to isolate your "class under test" from
anything else in the world. In order to do that, you very often have to create "test doubles" that
you provide to an object of your "class under test". You could create all those "test doubles"
manually; or you use a mocking framework that generates object of a certain class for you using
reflection techniques.
---
mocks are objects that are used in place real objects for the purpose of testing
--
mocking: replacing a real object with a simulated object that targets testing behavior
in a controlled way

Specifically, self-regulation works in three ways:
Self-monitoring determines how well you are currently performing.
Self-evaluation determines how well you are performing comparative to your goals.

software-defined networking (SDN), software-defined storage (SDS), and software-defined data center (SDDC).
====
With Software-Defined Everything, the computing infrastructure is virtualized and delivered as a
service. In a Software-Defined Everything environment, management and control of the networking,
storage and/or data center infrastructure is automated by intelligent software rather than by the
hardware components of the infrastructure.
===
The movement towards a software-defined infrastructure is about decoupling the bare metal that
executes the point data transactions from the software layer that orchestrates them. The hope is
that by separating the smarts from the brawn, the underlying hardware can become cheaper and
interchangeable (avoiding vendor lock-in) while the overarching software becomes more capable and
faster-evolving.
====
Software defined networking offers numerous benefits including on-demand provisioning, automated
load balancing, streamlined physical infrastructure and the ability to scale network resources in
lockstep with application and data needs. As noted on Enterprise Networking Planet, coupled with the
ongoing virtualization of servers and storage, SDN ushers in no less than the completely virtualized
data center, where end-to-end compute environments will be deployed and decommissioned on a whim.
====
software-defined anything: decouple the hardware from the software that controls the hardware
===
In general, SDN most commonly means that networks are controlled by software applications and SDN
controllers rather than the traditional network management consoles and commands that required a lot
of administrative overhead and could be tedious to manage on a large scale.
====
The basic principle underlying SDN is that it abstracts the
network to a set of capabilities that are independent of how
those capabilities are provided.
As a result, applications that use the network don’t have to include specific details of the network

SD‐WAN provides a software abstraction to create a network overlay and decouple network software
services from underlying hardware WAN circuits.
===
Sdn: creates an abstraction layer between the network hardware and the applications that use the network.
===
This network overlay provides a common interface across different physical components to ease the
overall network administration and enable network owners to develop their own infrastructure‐
independent applications.
===
Software‐Defined WAN (SD‐WAN) is the extension of SDN that is transforming the enterprise branch
office. With SD‐WAN, no longer are the advantages of SDN limited to the data center.
===
SD-WAN: it is SDN technology applied to WAN connections, including branch offices and data centers –
over large geographic distances.
===
Both SDN and SD‐WAN virtualize resources to provide accelerated services delivery, better
performance and improved availability by automating network deployment and management while reducing
the total cost of ownership.
====
SD-WAN separates functionality into a control plane layer and a data plane layer. The control plane
is the part of the network that is responsible for signaling traffic and making packet routing
decisions. It also includes device system configuration and management. The data plane is part of
the network that carries application and user data.
====
Essential to this concept is that one logical instance of the control plane serves multiple
instances of the data plane (typically switches and routers). In traditional networks, each instance
of the data plane contains its own control plane, making programming of the network impossible.
===
SD-WAN as a network overlay enables application traffic to be carried independently of the
underlying physical or transport layer, offering a transport‐independent overlay.  Multiple links,
even from different service providers, consti- tute a unified pool of resources, often referred to
as a virtual WAN.

A deed or reconveyance is a document issued by a mortgage holder indicating that the borrower is
released from the mortgage debt and transfers the property title from the lender, also called the
beneficiary, to the borrower, also called the trustor.

DevOps: the synergistic integration of development and operations

Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) is a discipline that incorporates aspects of software engineering
and applies them to infrastructure and operations problems.

The primary role of the Reliability Engineer is to identify and manage asset reliability risks that
could adversely affect plant or business operations.

Dev teams want to release awesome new features to the masses, and see them take off in a big
way. Ops teams want to make sure those features don’t break things. Historically, that’s caused a
big power struggle, with Ops trying to put the brakes on as many releases as possible, and Dev
looking for clever new ways to sneak around the processes that hold them back.

In computer networking, a wireless Access Point (AP) is a device that allows wireless devices to
connect to a wired network using Wi-Fi, or related standards. The AP usually connects to a router
(via a wired network) as a standalone device, but it can also be an integral component of the router
itself.

IP passthrough is an option for your DSL modem to turn into a "Bridge" or be just a simple modem -
whatever comes down the pipe from the internet goes right on through to your network without any
filtering or routing.
===
This would give your computer or anything else connected to your DSL modem a direct, unfiltered,
unNATed, public IP address. Since this is a serious security threat to any PC - your ISP has turned
on the NAT features of the DSL modem.
===
Why would you ever turn it off then?
Well, if you have a router or firewall of your own AND (and!) want to be able to connect to it
remotely from the internet - you can turn this off. This option is used by many businesses who have
people on the road and need to connect to their office network.

IP Passthrough means the AT&T supported CPE device terminates the DSL, authenticates with the
network (Receives a WAN IP) and shares that IP address with a single device connected to the AT&T
supported CPE equipment. This configuration is often times suitable for a business customer desiring
to connect third party equipment to AT&T supported equipment. The "IP Passthrough configuration
still allows AT&T support groups to access the AT&T supported equipment while allowing end-users to
connect third party equipment in a configuration they desire. The "IP Passthrough" configuration
will only allow one connection to AT&T supported equipment to be "unfiltered" or pingable from the
WAN or internet side of the AT&T equipment (does not support multiple pingable connections).

A CPE (customer premise equipment) device is telecommunications hardware located at the home or
business of a customer.

A digital subscriber line (DSL) modem is a device used to connect a computer or router to a
telephone line which provides the digital subscriber line service
===
A cable modem is a type of network bridge and modem that provides bi-directional data communication
via radio frequency channels on a hybrid fibre-coaxial (HFC) and radio frequency over glass (RFoG)
infrastructure

When two NAT devices are connected in series (for instance a modem with built-in NAT capabilities is
connected to a router which is also a NAT device), it is advisable to configure your modem in bridge
mode to avoid conflicts.
===
Bridge mode is the configuration that disables the NAT feature on the modem and allows a router to
function as a DHCP server without an IP Address conflict.  The modem has to be bridged before
connecting to a router since applications like VPN, P2P, and remote management require a public IP
Address on the router WAN port for a successful connection.

== EYE ===
Eye strain also known as asthenopia is an eye condition that manifests itself through nonspecific
symptoms such as fatigue, pain in or around the eyes, blurred vision, headache and occasional double
vision. Symptoms often occur after reading, computer work, or other close activities that involve
tedious visual tasks.

Eyestrain signs and symptoms include:
Sore, tired, burning or itching eyes
Watery or dry eyes
Blurred or double vision
Headache
Sore neck, shoulders or back
Increased sensitivity to light
Difficulty concentrating
Feeling that you cannot keep your eyes open

Dry Eye Symptoms
Burning sensation
Itchy eyes
Aching sensations
Heavy eyes
Fatigued eyes
Sore eyes
Dryness sensation
Red eyes
Photophobia (light sensitivity)
Blurred vision

fovea: a small depression in the retina of the eye where visual acuity is highest. The center of the
field of vision is focused in this region, where retinal cones are particularly concentrated.

Charles Bonnet syndrome: Visual release hallucinations, also known as Charles Bonnet syndrome (CBS),
is the experience of complex visual hallucinations in a person with partial or severe blindness.

A fluorescein angiography is a medical procedure in which a fluorescent dye is injected into the
bloodstream. The dye highlights the blood vessels in the back of the eye so they can be
photographed.

optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a non-invasive imaging test that uses light waves to take
cross-section pictures of your retina, the light-sensitive tissue lining the back of the eye. With
OCT, each of the retina's distinctive layers can be seen, allowing your ophthalmologist to map and
measure their thickness.O

Avastin injection: is the brand name for bevacizumab, a drug injected into the eye to slow vision
loss in people who have “wet” age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Avastin is part of a class of
drugs that block the growth of abnormal blood vessels, which is the cause of wet age-related macular
degeneration (AMD).

dry AMD:
a condition in which layers of the macula (including the photoreceptors and the retinal pigment
epithelium) get progressively thinner, functioning less and less as they do. This is called
atrophy. In the early stage of dry AMD, the pigment or color of the macula changes. Tiny drusen
appear on the retina: these are little piles of waste product of the cells of the eye. Drusen
themselves may lead to deterioration and atrophy of the retina. Dry AMD often does not progress
further than pigment discoloration and the presence of drusen. In fact, nearly everyone over 50
years of age has at least one small drusen. yellowish deposits form underneath the retina.
==
Dry AMD is also called non-neovascular AMD and non-exudative AMD because it does not involve the
exuding – that is, leakage – of fluids from blood vessels. Advanced cases – “late dry” AMD – are
called geographic atrophy (GA) because large sections of the retina that are well demarcated
(geographies) stop functioning.

wet AMD:
Wet AMD is a condition in which new blood vessels grow in the choroid layer behind the retina. This
condition is called choroidal neovascularization or CNV. The new vessels are weak, and they leak
fluid, lipids (part of the structure of cells), and blood. The leaking gets into the layers of the
retina – including the layers of the macula – and can cause scar tissue to form and retinal cells to
stop functioning.
==
Wet AMD is also called neovascular AMD or exudative AMD because it involves the exudation or leakage
of fluid and blood from new blood vessels.

A heat map (or heatmap) is a graphical representation of data where the individual values contained
in a matrix are represented as colors.

=== WIFI
When an 802.11 client device hears another signal, whether it is a Wi-Fi signal or not, it will
defer transmission until the signal ceases. Interference that occurs during transmission also causes
packet loss, which forces Wi-Fi retransmissions. These retransmissions slow throughput and result in
wildly fluctuating performance for all users sharing a given access point (AP).
--
APs and wireless clients on the same channel who are also within range of each other form a single
broadcast domain, similar to an Ethernet hub. All devices can hear each other's transmissions and if
any two devices transmit at the same time, their radio signals will collide and become garbled
resulting in data corruption or complete frame loss. If there is an excessive amount of collisions,
data would never be transmitted successfully and the wireless network would be unusable. To avoid
collisions, 802.11 wireless devices use a listen before speaking approach when accessing the
wireless medium. Specifically, devices perform a Clear Channel Assessment (CCA) by listening to see
if another device is actively transmitting on the channel before attempting to send its own
frames. When a device detects another transmission in progress, it will perform a random back-off
for a short period of time after which it would perform another check before attempting to transmit
again. If the channel is clear after a check, the device can access the channel and send some
data. As the number of devices needing to transmit frames increase on the channel, congestion can
occur to the point where devices spend more time receiving than sending. This results in slower
speeds because devices have to wait longer to send data.

When two wireless devices transmit at the same time, their radio signals will collide and become
garbled. 802.11 devices on the same channel use a CCA check to avoid these collisions. However, the
CCA check may not detect a transmission occurring on a different channel that also has some
frequency overlap on the channel the check is being performed on. In this case, two 802.11 devices
on different channels that overlap may transmit at the same time causing a collision and possible
data corruption or frame loss. This is called interference because one device's transmission
interferes with another device's transmission. As the number of interfering devices increase, so
does the potential for frame loss. The 802.11 standard uses a reliable transport mechanism where
each sent data frame must be ACK'd by the receiver to ensure the frame was not lost in transit or
corrupted. If a the sender does not receive an ACK, it must re-transmit the same frame until an ACK
is received. Re-transmissions result slower speeds because it takes longer to successfully send a
single frame.

A flash cut, also called a flash cutover, is an immediate change in a complex system, with no
phase-in period. In the United States, some telephone area codes were split immediately, rather than
being phased in with a permissive dialing period.

Contrast is the perceived difference between two adjacent colors.
==
Because white and black are not really colors, they are said to represent achromatic contrast. Black
and white also represent the highest level of contrast. Complementary colors from the color wheel
represent high chromatic contrast.

SSID is the name assigned by the user to identify the AP. This is the one you see when you search
for WiFi. Example: Home-WiFi [Name-upto 64 character]

BSSID is usually associated with AP’s MAC address of the AP. This information is sent in the AP
beacon but can not be seen by user unless he is using some kind of analyser/tools.  Example:
0000.1111.3333 [hexadecimal- 12 character(0–f) ]

ESSID is associated with multiple AP. All the AP will broadcast same SSID. But the beacon will have
different BSSID info. It involves roaming. The user gets connected to the AP that has maximum
strength (RSSI)

First lightly read through the chapters, highlighting or underlining the key concepts in each
chapter that seem the most important. then apply Feynman technique:
1. Choose the concept you wish to understand (or wish to check whether you understand) and write
down the name of the concept.
2. Then try to explain the idea to yourself as if you were teaching it to someone who didn't
understand it at all. This will help you develop a deeper understanding of what you already
understand but also will help you pinpoint exactly the things you don't understand.
3. Once you identify the gaps in your knowledge, go back to the reference material and reread or
relearn the material until you can explain it in your own words.

=== histogram vs bar chart ===
Histograms are a special form of bar chart where the data represent continuous rather than discrete
categories. This means that in a histogram there are no gaps between the columns representing the
different categories.
===
Histogram is a chart representing a frequency distribution
histogram: Usually, there is no space between adjacent Bars.
==
Bar Chart
The columns are positioned over a label that represents a categorical variable.
The height of the column indicates the size of the group defined by the categories.
---
Histogram
The columns are positioned over a label that represents a quantitative variable.
The column label can be a single value or a range of values.
histogram: display how many data points lie in each of a series of intervals.
--
Here is the main difference between them. With bar charts, each column represents a group defined by
a categorical variable; and with histograms, each column represents a group defined by a
quantitative variable.
===
histograms are used to show distributions of variables while bar charts are used to compare
variables
---
Histograms plot quantitative data with ranges of the data grouped into bins or intervals while bar
charts plot categorical data.
==
Histograms plot binned quantitative data while bar charts plot categorical data.
Bars can be reordered in bar charts but not in histograms.
====
histogram: display data points over a series of intervals
bar chart: display data points over categories
===
bar chart: show a measure across multiple categories
histogram: show the frequency of observations of a numerical variable grouped into bins
  bin: equal-width partition

Mode setting is a software operation that activates a display mode (screen resolution, color depth,
and refresh rate) for a computer's display controller.
===
In kernel mode-setting (KMS), the display mode is set by the kernel. In user-space mode-setting
(UMS), the display mode is set by a userland process.
===
Kernel mode-setting is more flexible and allows displaying of an error in the case of a fatal error
in the kernel, even when using a user-space display server.
===
User-space mode setting would require superuser privileges for direct hardware access, so
kernel-based mode setting shuns such requirement for the user-space graphics server.

video card, graphics card, display adapter, video adapter, display controller:
A Graphics Card is a piece of computer hardware that produces the image you see on a monitor. The
Graphics Card is responsible for rendering an image to your monitor, it does this by converting data
into a signal your monitor can understand.
==
Video RAM is really a buffer between the computer processor and the display and is often called the
frame buffer.
==
When images are to be sent to the display, they are first read by the processor as data from some
form of main (non-video) RAM and then written to video RAM. From video RAM (the frame buffer), the
data is converted by a RAM digital-to-analog converter (RAMDAC) into analog signals that are sent to
the display presentation mechanism such as a cathode ray tube (CRT).
==
Usually, video RAM comes in a 1 or 2 megabyte package and is located on the video adapter card in
the computer. Most forms of video RAM are dual-ported, which means that while the processor is
writing a new image to video RAM, the display is reading from video RAM to refresh its current
display content. The dual-port design is the main difference between main RAM and video RAM.

Merkle Tree is a data structure where every non-leaf node contains the hash of the labels of its
child nodes, and the leaves have their own values hashed. Because of this characteristic, Merkle
Trees are used to verify that two or more parties have the same data without exchanging the entire
data collection.
==
A merkle tree, also known as a binary hash tree, is a data structure used for efficiently
summarizing and verifying the integrity of large sets of data. Merkle trees are binary trees
containing cryptographic hashes.
---
merkle/hash tree allows efficient verification of the contents of large data structures.
the leaf node contains the hash of a block of data in file(s).
the non-leaf node contains the hash of the hash of its children.
example:
parent has two leaf nodes: hash0 and hash1
hash0 is the hash of data block #1
hash1 is the hash of data block #2
parent has the hash of (hash0+hash1)
---
Merkle tree: a binary tree where the nodes store hashes of data rather than the data itself.
merkle tree: node is labelled with the hash value of its contents, which include
the hash of its children

The OS kernel abstracts away the difference in hardware in the form of an uniform interface.

The NDC, or National Drug Code, is a unique 10-digit, 3-segment number. It is a universal product
identifier for human drugs in the United States. The code is present on all nonprescription (OTC)
and prescription medication packages and inserts in the US. The 3 segments of the NDC identify the
labeler, the the product, and the commercial package size. The first set of numbers in the NDC
identifies the labeler (manufacturer, repackager, or distributer). The second set of numbers is the
product code, which identifies the specific strength, dosage form (i.e, capsule, tablet, liquid) and
formulation of a drug for a specific manufacturer. Finally, the third set is the package code, which
identifies package sizes and types. The labeler code is assigned by the FDA, while the product and
package code are assigned by the labeler.

In a computer network, a link-local address is a network address that is valid only for
communications within the network segment (link) or the broadcast domain that the host is connected
to.
--
Link-local addresses are not guaranteed to be unique beyond a single network segment. Routers
therefore do not forward packets with link-local addresses.
--
IPv4LL: Link-local addresses for IPv4 are defined in the address block 169.254.0.0/16, in CIDR notation. In
IPv6, they are assigned with the prefix fe80::/64, although being defined as the block fe80::/10.
--
Media access control (MAC) addresses used in local broadcast networks, such as Ethernet, are
link-local addresses. Such devices are configured with an address in hardware by the
manufacturer. However, operating system utilities, such as ifconfig may be used to assign or change
these addresses. This is essential when an operating system is running in a virtual machine
environment.

Zero-configuration networking (zeroconf) is a set of technologies that automatically creates a
usable computer network based on the Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP) when computers or network
peripherals are interconnected. It does not require manual operator intervention or special
configuration servers.

A common technique for remembering the order of operations is the abbreviation "PEMDAS", which is

Model–view–view-model (MVVM) is a software architectural pattern.
--
MVVM facilitates a separation of development of the graphical user interface – be it via a markup
language or GUI code – from development of the business logic or back-end logic (the data
model). The view model of MVVM is a value converter; meaning the view model is responsible for
exposing (converting) the data objects from the model in such a way that objects are easily managed
and presented. In this respect, the view model is more model than view, and handles most if not all
of the view's display logic. The view model may implement a mediator pattern, organizing access
to the back-end logic around the set of use cases supported by the view.
--
Model–view–viewmodel is also referred to as model–view–binder, especially in implementations not
involving the .NET platform.
--
Model refers either to a domain model, which represents real state content (an object-oriented
approach), or to the data access layer, which represents content (a data-centric approach).

view-model -> The view model is an abstraction of the view exposing public properties and
commands. Instead of the controller of the MVC pattern, or the presenter of the MVP pattern, MVVM
has a binder. In the view model, the binder mediates communication between the view and the data
binder. The view model has been described as a state of the data in the model.
--
MVVM: designed to separate development of the view layer (HTML) from the business logic (JavaScript)
and data layers (JSON).
--
MVVM: the model represents the app data, the view is the presentation of the data. the ViewModel exposes
the data from the model to the view and maintains the application's state.

(content delivery network) CDNs deliver improved performance by globally distributing assets as well
as improved scalability by removing load from your webserver.
==
CDN: a globally distributed network of proxy servers deployed in multiple data centers. The goal of a CDN
is to serve content to end-users with high availability and high performance.
--
content delivery network (CDN) is a system of distributed servers (network) that deliver webpages
and other Web content to a user based on the geographic locations of the user, the origin of the
webpage and a content delivery server.
--
--
cdn : url rewrite:
Normally your URL paths would be something similar to:
href="http://domain.com/wp-content/uploads/image.jpg
With a CDN enabled, they become:
http://<cdnzonename>.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/image.jpg
---
push vs pull CDN:
pull CDN: the first time you access the CDN, the CDN pulls from original host.
pushd CDN: you push the static content to the CDN beforehand

Markup languages are designed for the processing, definition and presentation of text. The language
specifies code for formatting, both the layout and style, within a text file. The code used to
specify the formatting are called tags. HTMLis a an example of a widely known and used markup
language.
===
A markup language is a type of language used to annotate text and embed tags in documents.
--
3 types of markup language: Presentational Markup, Procedural Markup, Descriptive Markup
--
A markup language is a system for annotating a document in a way that is syntactically
distinguishable from the text.

interview questions to company:

How does the company reward top performers and what is the criteria for evaluating outstanding performance?
Is it a newly created position or a replacement position?
What are the good qualities of the individual currently performing this role? Is there anything you
  as a leader think should be delivered better in this position?

Reactive applications consists of components that send messages or events to each other.

concurrency model:
parallel worker model: Incoming jobs are assigned to different workers
====
In the parallel worker concurrency model a delegator distributes the incoming jobs to different
workers. Each worker completes the full job. The workers work in parallel, running in different
threads, and possibly on different CPUs.
If the parallel worker model was implemented in a car factory, each car would be produced by one
worker. The worker would get the specification of the car to build, and would build everything from
start to end.
-----
assembly line model (reactive/event-driven system):
The workers are organized like workers at an assembly line in a factory. Each worker only performs a
part of the full job. When that part is finished the worker forwards the job to the next worker.
Each worker is running in its own thread, and shares no state with other workers. This is also
sometimes referred to as a shared nothing concurrency model.
--
Systems using the assembly line concurrency model are usually designed to use non-blocking
IO. Non-blocking IO means that when a worker starts an IO operation (e.g. reading a file or data
from a network connection) the worker does not wait for the IO call to finish.
--
With non-blocking IO, the IO operations determine the boundary between workers. A worker does as
much as it can until it has to start an IO operation. Then it gives up control over the job. When
the IO operation finishes, the next worker in the assembly line continues working on the job, until
that too has to start an IO operation etc.

actors vs channels
actors: send messages directly to each other
channels: workers do not communicate directly with each other. they publish messages on different
channels.

Java EE uses the parallel worker model. Vert.x on the other hand, uses the assembly line model with
channels.

Same-threading is a concurrency model where a single-threaded systems are scaled out to N
single-threaded systems. The result is N single-threaded systems running in parallel.

triangulation: comparing the relative signal strength between three cellular towers

A reentrant lock is one where a thread can claim the lock multiple times without blocking on itself.

The C10k problem is the problem of optimising network sockets to handle a large number of clients at
the same time. The name C10k is a numeronym for concurrently handling ten thousand
connections. Note that concurrent connections are not the same as requests per second, though
they are similar: handling many requests per second requires high throughput (processing them
quickly), while high number of concurrent connections requires efficient scheduling of
connections. In other words, handling many requests per second is concerned with the speed of
handling requests, whereas a system capable of handling high number of concurrent connections does
not necessarily have to be a fast system, only one where each request will deterministically return
a response within a (not necessarily fixed) finite amount of time.

agile: creating small, cross-functional, self-contained teams that deliver solutions in
quick increments.

Per stirpes ("by branch") is a legal term in Latin. An estate of a decedent is distributed per
stirpes if each branch of the family is to receive an equal share of an estate.
alternative: per capita by generation

The SIP URI scheme is a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) scheme for the Session Initiation Protocol
(SIP) multimedia communications protocol. A SIP address is a URI that addresses a specific telephone
extension on a voice over IP system. Such a number could be a private branch exchange or an E.164
telephone number dialled through a specific gateway.
==
A SIP address is written in user@domain.tld format in a similar fashion to an email address. An address like:
==
sip:1-999-123-4567@voip-provider.example.net instructs a SIP client to make a (usually UDP)
connection to voip-provider.example.net:5060 (which may be a gateway) and ask to be connected to the
destination user at 1-999-123-4567. The gateway may require the user REGISTER using SIP before
placing this call. The default Internet port address for SIP is 5060 unless explicitly specified in
the URI.
===
The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is a communications protocol for signaling and controlling
multimedia communication sessions. The most common applications of SIP are in Internet telephony for
voice and video calls, as well as instant messaging, over Internet Protocol (IP) networks.
--
SIP Phones are also called VoIP Phones or Softphones. These are telephones that use VoIP
technologies for making calls over both an IP Network or the traditional PSTN networks. There are
two types of SIP Phones.
--
There are two types of SIP Phones. The first type is the hardware SIP phone. It resembles the
typical telephone, but uses purpose-built hardware to receive and makes calls using the Internet,
instead of the traditional PSTN system. The second type is software-based. These allow any computer
to be used as a telephone by means of a headset with a microphone and/or a sound card. A broadband
connection and connection to a VoIP provider or a SIP Server are also required. Software SIP Phones
can also run on mobile devices such as Android and iOS.
--
A SIP server is the main component of an IP PBX, and mainly deals with the setup of all SIP calls in
the network. A SIP server is also referred to as a SIP Proxy or a Registrar. Although the SIP server
is the most important part of the SIP based phone system, it only handles call setup and call tear
down.

In trigonometry and geometry, triangulation is the process of determining the location of a point by
forming triangles to it from known points.
--
Mobile phone tracking is the ascertaining of the position or location of a mobile phone, whether
stationary or moving. Localization may occur either via multilateration of radio signals between
(several) cell towers of the network and the phone, or simply via GPS. To locate a mobile phone
using multilateration of radio signals, it must emit at least the roaming signal to contact the next
nearby antenna tower, but the process does not require an active call.
--
Multilateration (MLAT) is a navigation technique based on the measurement of the difference in
distance to two stations at known locations by broadcast signals at known times. Unlike measurements
of absolute distance or angle, measuring the difference in distance between two stations results in
an infinite number of locations that satisfy the measurement. When these possible locations are
plotted, they form a hyperbolic curve. To locate the exact location along that curve,
multilateration relies on multiple measurements: a second measurement taken to a different pair of
stations will produce a second curve, which intersects with the first. When the two curves are
compared, a small number of possible locations are revealed, producing a "fix".

omni-channel:
denoting or relating to a type of retail that integrates the different methods of shopping available
to consumers (e.g., online, in a physical store, or by phone).

blue-green deployment
is a release technique that reduces downtime and risk by running two identical production
environments called Blue and Green. At any time, only one of the environments is live, with the live
environment serving all production traffic.
--
Canary Tests are minimal tests to quickly and automatically verify that the everything you depend on
is ready. You run Canary tests before other time-consuming tests, and before wasting time
investigating in your code when the other tests are red.
--
Dark launching is the practice of deploying the very first version of a service into its production
environment, well before release, so that you can soak test it and find any bugs before you make its
functionality available to users.
--
Rolling deployments are a pattern whereby, instead of deploying a package to all servers at once, we
slowly roll out the release by deploying it to each server one-by-one. In load balanced scenarios,
this allows us to reduce overall downtime.
--
Canary release is a technique to reduce the risk of introducing a new software version in production
by slowly rolling out the change to a small subset of users before rolling it out to the entire
infrastructure and making it available to everybody.

(EXIF) Exchangeable image file format is a standard that specifies the formats for images, sound, and
ancillary tags used by digital cameras.

ID3 is a metadata container most often used in conjunction with the MP3 audio file format. It allows
information such as the title, artist, album, track number, and other information about the file to
be stored in the file itself.

Peter principle:
a concept in management theory formulated by Laurence J. Peter and published in 1969. It states that
the selection of a candidate for a position is based on the candidate's performance in their current
role, rather than on abilities relevant to the intended role. Thus, employees only stop being
promoted once they can no longer perform effectively, and "managers rise to the level of their
incompetence."

application performance management (APM) is the monitoring and management of performance and
availability of software applications. APM strives to detect and diagnose complex application
performance problems to maintain an expected level of service.

Aggregate functions return a single result row based on groups of rows, rather than on single rows.

In cryptography, a commitment scheme allows one to commit to a chosen value (or chosen statement)
while keeping it hidden to others, with the ability to reveal the committed value later.[1]
Commitment schemes are designed so that a party cannot change the value or statement after they have
committed to it: that is, commitment schemes are binding. Commitment schemes have important
applications in a number of cryptographic protocols including secure coin flipping, zero-knowledge
proofs, and secure computation.

Typography is the art and technique of arranging type to make written language legible, readable,
and appealing when displayed

A blocking queue is a queue that blocks when you try to dequeue from it and the queue is empty, or
if you try to enqueue items to it and the queue is already full.

A web container (also known as a servlet container; and compare "webtainer") is the component of a
web server that interacts with Java servlets. A web container is responsible for managing the
lifecycle of servlets, mapping a URL to a particular servlet and ensuring that the URL requester has
the correct access-rights.
--
Servlets are Java programming language classes that dynamically process requests and construct
responses.
==
A servlet is simply a class which responds to a particular type of network request - most commonly
an HTTP request.

Emmetropia is a state in which the eye is relaxed and focused on an object more than 6 meters or 20
feet away. The light rays coming from that object are essentially parallel, and the rays are focused
on the retina without effort.

Play framework:
controller: handle incoming http requests and use the model and view to build and return a response
model: business logic
view: combine model data with view templates

internationalization: removing locale-specifc code from the application.
localization: making a locale-specifc version of an application

translation lookaside buffer (TLB) is a memory cache that stores recent translations of virtual
memory to physical addresses for faster retrieval.
===
TLB: a cache of recent virtual-to-physical address mappings.

ILP (instruction-level parallelism): a measure of how many of the instructions in a computer program
can be executed simultaneously.

--False sharing
Memory is stored within the cache system in units known as cache lines.  Cache lines are a power of 2
of contiguous bytes which are typically 32-256 in size.  The most common cache line size is 64
bytes.  False sharing is a term which applies when threads unwittingly impact the performance of
each other while modifying independent variables sharing the same cache line.  Write contention on
cache lines is the single most limiting factor on achieving scalability for parallel threads of
execution in an SMP system.
--
where threads use different objects but those objects happen to be close enough in memory that they
fall on the same cache line, and the cache system treats them as a single lump that is effectively
protected by a hardware write lock that only one core can hold at a time
---
CPU cache is effectively unchained hash map where each bucket is typically 64 bytes.
These caches can be thought of as simple hardware hash tables with fixed size buckets and no chaining
cache line: the effective unit of cache memory transfer.

cache is smaller, faster memory that stores recently accessed data so that future requests
for that data can be served faster.
--
Data is transferred between memory and cache in blocks of fixed size, called cache lines or cache
blocks. When a cache line is copied from memory into the cache, a cache entry is created. The cache
entry will include the copied data as well as the requested memory location (called a tag).
===
cache line: the smallest unit of data transferred between memory and CPU cache.

commutative: changing the order does not change the result
associative: does not matter how we group the numbers
distributive:  a × (b + c) = a × b + a × c

serverless architecture: is an approach that replaces long-running virtual machines with ephemeral
compute power that comes into existence on request and disappears immediately after use.
--
Serverless architectures refer to applications that significantly depend on third-party services
(knows as Backend as a Service or "BaaS") or on custom code that's run in ephemeral containers
(Function as a Service or "FaaS"), the best known vendor host of which currently is AWS Lambda.

non-blocking concurrency: reactive programming

the fundamental unit of reactive reasoning is the stream of events. Events can come in the form of
objects, data feeds, mouse movements, or even exceptions.
everything is a stream.

ReactiveX is a library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs by using observable
sequences.
--
RxJava is the open-source implementation of ReactiveX in Java. The two main classes are Observable

Configuration management tools are used to repeatably and consistently manage the configuration of
systems and the services that they provide entirely through code.

when a variable declared within a certain scope has the same name as a variable declared in
an outer scope, we say that the outer variable is shadowed.

Kadane's algorithm: solve Maximum subarray problem
the task of finding the contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional array of numbers which has the
largest sum. For example, for the sequence of values −2, 1, −3, 4, −1, 2, 1, −5, 4; the contiguous
subarray with the largest sum is 4, −1, 2, 1, with sum 6.

Config Management is part of provisioning. Basically, that’s using a tool like Chef, Puppet or
Ansible to configure your server. “Provisioning” often implies it’s the first time you do it. Config
management usually happens repeatedly.
Provisioning: making something ready for use.

How are they going to use it?
How many users are there?
What does the system do?
What are the inputs and outputs of the system?
How much data do we expect to handle?
How many requests per second do we expect?
What is the expected read to write ratio?

scaling: load balancer, horizontal scaling, caching, database sharding

high availability: fail-over or replication

Federation (or functional partitioning) splits up databases by function. For example, instead of a
single, monolithic database, you could have three databases: forums, users, and products

Denormalization attempts to improve read performance at the expense of some write
performance. Redundant copies of the data are written in multiple tables to avoid expensive joins.

benchmarking: simulate high-load situations

A wide column store's basic unit of data is a column (name/value pair). A column can be grouped in
column families (analogous to a SQL table). Super column families further group column families. You
can access each column independently with a row key, and columns with the same row key form a
row. Each value contains a timestamp for versioning and for conflict resolution.

HTTP redirect:
301 tells the browser that the resource at the uri has been changed permanently to the new location,
typically to the value of the ‘Location’ response header. The browser makes a new request and
subsequently, the browser will NOT make another request to the original link (even if manually typed
in the address bar by the user)
--
302 tells the browser that the resource at the uri has been changed temporarily. The browser will
redirect to the new location this time ONLY. The next time a request comes to the original uri, the
browser will in fact hit the original uri.
--
303 is almost as the same as 302, the only difference being that it tells the browser to make the
second request using the GET verb. so even a POST will be converted to a GET
--
307: This is the same as 302 except it tells the browser that the next request should be made with the
same verb as the original, in this case GET. In other words, even a POST to the original link,
should redirected by a POST to the new link.

<link rel="canonical" href="your link"/>
A canonical link element is an HTML element that helps webmasters prevent duplicate content issues
by specifying the "canonical" or "preferred" version of a web page as part of search engine
optimization.

Too much of anything becomes its opposite

YAML:
Values can span multiple lines using | or >. Spanning multiple lines using a | will include the

short sale: the owner is selling a house for less than the mortgage owed on the house
--
A pre-foreclosure is a property in the process of foreclosure but is still legally owned by the
owner. It may or may not be a short sale.
Pre-foreclosure means an owner is greater than 90 days late on payments and lender has started the
foreclosure process with a notice of trustee sale.
--
Foreclosures are bank owned properties.

an isomorphic application is one whose code (in this case, JavaScript) can run both in the server
and the client. Isomorphic JavaScript.
--
Isomorphism is the functional aspect of seamlessly switching between client- and server-side
rendering without losing state. Universal is a term used to emphasize the fact that a particular
piece of JavaScript code is able to run in multiple environments.
--
With client-side rendering, your initial request loads the page layout, CSS and JavaScript. It's all
common except that some or all of the content isn't included. Instead, the JavaScript makes another
request, gets a response (likely in JSON), and generates the appropriate HTML (likely using a
templating library).
--
With server-side rendering, your initial request loads the page, layout, CSS, JavaScript and
content.
---
client-side rendering requires a heavier initial load with a 2nd request, not being able to cache
the final output and greater dependency on slower CPUs and rendering engines.
==
isomorphic rendering: render everything on the backend when loading the page first time, but everything after that is
rendered on the frontend. rendering pages on both the server and client side.
----
isomorphism: the web application can be rendered on multiple platforms (browser or server). not specific
to JavaScript.
universal JavaScript: can run anywhere

IPP (internet printing protocol):
new protocol that allows personal computers and mobile devices to find and print to networked and
USB printers without using vendor-specific software.
--
Most of the printers sold these days already support IPP protocol. This means that you don’t need to
install drivers for printer from XYZ manufacturer. You can search for it on the network and use it
for printing.

responsive web design:
fluid grids: percentage-based widths rather than fixed-pixel dimensions
flexible images:

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an attack that forces an end user to execute unwanted actions
on a web application in which they're currently authenticated. CSRF attacks specifically target
state-changing requests, not theft of data, since the attacker has no way to see the response to the
forged request.
--
CSRF: an attack vector that tricks a web browser into executing an unwanted action in a web
application where a user is already logged in.
--
CSRFs are typically conducted using malicious social engineering, such as an email or link that
tricks the victim into sending a forged request to a server.

IRA Rollover: Taking receipt of the assets for up to 60 days before reinvesting in a new retirement plan.
IRA Transfer: Moving the assets directly from one custodian to another custodian without taking receipt of the funds.

Asymptotic Notations are languages that allow us to analyze an algorithm's running time by
identifying its behavior as the input size for the algorithm increases. This is also known as an
algorithm's growth rate.

An asymptotic behavior is the tendency of the independent variable (e.g. x) of a function (f(x)) to
increase or decrease without bound. If such a function approaches a number, then the function is
said to have an asymptote at that number.

In mathematical analysis, asymptotic analysis is a method of describing limiting behavior.
in computer science in the analysis of algorithms, considering the performance of algorithms when
applied to very very big input datasets.

Think of a digital twin as a bridge between the physical and digital world.
--
Digital twins refer to computerized companions of physical assets that can be used for various
purposes. Digital twins use data from sensors installed on physical objects to represent their near
real-time status, working condition or position.

polynomial time complexity: An algorithm is said to be solvable in polynomial time if the number of
steps required to complete the algorithm for a given input is O(n^k), where n is the complexity of
the input and k is a non-negative integer. Polynomial-time algorithms are said to be "fast"
--
NP (which stands for nondeterministic polynomial time) is the set of problems whose solutions can be
verified in polynomial time. But as far as anyone can tell, many of those problems take exponential
time to solve.
--
P versus NP problem:
Informally speaking, it asks whether every problem whose solution can be quickly verified by a
computer can also be quickly solved by a computer.
P vs NP: If the solution to a problem can be verified in polynomial time, can it be found in polynomial time?

The genetic algorithm is a method for solving both constrained and unconstrained optimization
problems that is based on natural selection, the process that drives biological evolution. The
genetic algorithm repeatedly modifies a population of individual solutions.

linear programming: a mathematical technique for maximizing or minimizing a linear function of
several variables, such as output or cost.

A linear function is any function that graphs to a straight line. What this means mathematically is
that the function has either one or two variables with no exponents or powers. If the function has
more variables, the variables must be constants or known variables for the function to remain a
linear function.

Mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) is a very general framework for capturing problems with both
discrete decisions and continuous variables.

The Northwest Corner Method (or upper left-hand corner) is a heuristic that is applied to a special
type of Linear Programming problem structure called the Transportation Model,

viewport is the user's visible area of a web page.

a reference to a local object can "escape" from a method:
1. the method returns the object
2. the method stores the object into a variable that has greater visibility and lifetime,
such as static variable or collection.
3. the method can pass the object as a method argument.

parallelization:
1. you have a pool of threads
2. divide the task into subtasks

Benchmarking is comparing one's business processes and performance metrics to industry bests and
best practices from other companies.

In computing, a benchmark is the act of running a computer program, a set of programs, or other
operations, in order to assess the relative performance of an object, normally by running a number
of standard tests and trials against it.
--
A benchmark is a test used to compare performance between multiple things, either against each other
or against an accepted standard. In the computer world, benchmarks are often used to compare the
speeds or performances of hardware components, software programs, and even internet connections.
--
Benchmarking compares it to competitors or peers.  Baselining compares it to your own historical
performance.

microbenchmarking: measuring the performance of something "small", like a system call to the kernel
of an operating system.

Load testing is the process of putting demand on a system or device and measuring its response. When
the load placed on the system is raised beyond normal usage patterns, in order to test the system's
response at unusually high or peak loads, it is known as stress testing.

Matchback and street-turn are used interchangeable and refer to the matching of import and export
containers to minimize the miles driven, increase container velocity and reduce emissions.

HTTP pipelining is a technique in which multiple HTTP requests are sent on a single TCP connection
without waiting for the corresponding responses.

HTTP persistent connection, also called HTTP keep-alive, or HTTP connection reuse, is the idea of
using a single TCP connection to send and receive multiple HTTP requests/responses, as opposed to
opening a new connection for every single request/response pair. The newer HTTP/2 protocol uses the
same idea and takes it further to allow multiple concurrent requests/responses to be multiplexed
over a single connection.
--
In HTTP 1.1, all connections are considered persistent unless declared otherwise. The HTTP
persistent connections do not use separate keepalive messages, they just allow multiple requests to
use a single connection.

core dump: a dump of the contents of main memory

The Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) is an obsolete method for implementing virtual private
networks, with many known security issues. PPTP uses a TCP control channel and a GRE tunnel to
encapsulate PPP packets.

A red–black tree is a kind of self-balancing binary search tree. Each node of the binary tree has an
extra bit, and that bit is often interpreted as the color (red or black) of the node. These color
bits are used to ensure the tree remains approximately balanced during insertions and deletions

Hybrid Mobile Applications. Hybrid development combines the best (or worst) of both the native and
HTML5 worlds. We define hybrid as a web app, primarily built using HTML5 and JavaScript, that is
then wrapped inside a thin native container that provides access to native platform features.
-- combine characteristics of both native and web applications.

Apache Cordova provides a group of APIs that enable you to develop an application with HTML, CSS and
JavaScript that is packaged as a native mobile application. The application runs on the mobile
device and can access the native functions of the device such as the GPS or camera.

Wide column stores, also called extensible record stores, store data in records with an ability to
hold very large numbers of dynamic columns. Since the column names as well as the record keys are
not fixed, and since a record can have billions of columns, wide column stores can be seen as
two-dimensional key-value stores.
--
Wide column stores share the chracteristic of being schema-free with document stores, however the
implementation is very different.
--example: Cassandra, HBase

MVVM vs MVC
One difference that people miss is in MVC,the controller chooses the view(ex. web server). After the
view is chosen, the view's state isn't connected to the controller. MVVM, the state of the view is
continuously connected to the ViewModel(has some features similar to the controller).

token-based authentication: uses a signed token that the client must send on every request.

Electron (formerly known as Atom Shell) is an open-source framework developed by GitHub. It allows

servers." In particular, the use of SYN cookies allows a server to avoid dropping connections when
the SYN queue fills up.

A uses B -> A depends on B
A is the dependent, B is the dependency

stack trace (aka stack backtrace or stack traceback)
is a report of the active stack frames at a certain point in time during the execution of a program.
---
A traceback is a stack trace from the point of an exception handler down the call chain to the point
where the exception was raised. You can also work with the current call stack up from the point of a
call (and without the context of an error), which is useful for finding out the paths being followed
into a function.
--
A backtrace is a list of the function calls that are currently active in a thread
--
A Stack Trace is a list of method calls from the point when the application was started to the
current location of execution within the program.
--
stack trace: a list of method calls from the exception handler to the point where the exception was
raised.

Edge computing pushes applications, data and computing power (services) away from centralized points
to the logical extremes of a network
==
data processing power at the edge of a network instead of holding that processing power in a cloud
or a central data warehouse.
--
An edge device is a device which provides an entry point into enterprise or service provider core
networks. Examples include routers, routing switches, integrated access devices (IADs),
multiplexers, and a variety of metropolitan area network (MAN) and wide area network (WAN) access
devices.
--
move computation that's currently centralized inside the cloud back to the edge in a distributed manner.

portable hotspot taps into 3G and/or 4G cellular networks, just like a smartphone does, and then
wirelessly shares its data connection with other nearby (within 30 feet or so) Wi-Fi-enabled
gadgets—typically, between three and 8 or more at a time, depending on the device and the carrier.

DOM (Document Object Model): a way to represent and work with XML and HTML data.
--
DOM is the language-independent representation of the HTML documents, which deines the structure
of the document.
--
XPath is a way to navigate an XML document.

DOM stands for Document Object Model and is an abstraction of a structured text. For web developers,
this text is an HTML code, and the DOM is simply called HTML DOM. Elements of HTML become nodes in
the DOM. So, while HTML is a text, the DOM is an in-memory representation of this text.
==
The HTML DOM provides an API to traverse and modify the nodes. It contains methods like
getElementById or removeChild.
whenever we want to dynamicly change the content of the web page, we modify the DOM
HTML DOM is always tree-structured
==
Virtual DOM is an abstraction of the HTML DOM. It is lightweight and detached from the
browser-specific implementation details. Since the DOM itself was already an abstraction, the
virtual DOM is, in fact, an abstraction of an abstraction.

how to ensure consistency in the cloud:
1.
bounded staleness, gives you a point at which reads and writes are in sync. Before it, there’s no
guarantee, after it, you’re always accessing the latest version (at least until the next time that
item updates). You define the boundary as either a number of versions or a time interval. Outside
the boundary, everything is consistent, inside it, there’s no guarantee of a read returning the
latest data. The result is a store that has an element of strong consistency, while still giving you
low latency and the option of global distribution and high reliability. You use this model if you
want to be sure that all reads are consistent, wherever they are, and that all writes are fast. You
also get data that’s correct if you read it in the region where it’s written.
2.
session consistency, works well when you drive reads and writes from a client app. The client gets
to read its own writes, while data replicates across the rest of the network. This way, you have low
latency access to the data you need, along with knowing that you’ll fail over in the event of any
downtime—and that your application will run in any Azure region.
3.
consistent prefix, in Cosmos DB. Consistent prefix adds predictability to the speed of eventual
consistency. You might not see the latest write when you read the data, but your reads will never
be out of order. That’s a useful feature, because it’s both fast and predictable. Write A, then B,
and then C, and your client will see A, or A and B, but never just A and C. Eventually all the
Cosmos DB regions will converge on A, B, and C, giving you speed and reliability.

Constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) are mathematical problems defined as a set of objects whose
state must satisfy a number of constraints or limitations.
--
In artificial intelligence and operations research, constraint satisfaction is the process of
finding a solution to a set of constraints that impose conditions that the variables must satisfy.
--
In mathematics, a constraint is a condition of an optimization problem that the solution must satisfy.

A core is usually the basic computation unit of the CPU - it can run a single program context (or
multiple ones if it supports hardware threads such as hyperthreading on Intel CPUs), maintaining the
correct program state, registers, and correct execution order, and performing the operations through
ALUs.
A CPU/processor is a chip that fits into a socket. A CPU/processor may have multiple cores.

pro forma: Assumed, forecasted, or informal information presented in advance of the actual or formal
information. The common objective of a pro forma document is to give a fair idea of the cash outlay
for a shipment or an anticipated occurrence. Pro forma financial statements give an idea of how the
actual statement will look if the underlying assumptions hold true.

Inflammation is the activation of the immune system in response to infection, irritation, or injury.
Inflammation is a protective mechanism in the body.

In computer science, the count-distinct problem (also known in applied mathematics as the
cardinality estimation problem) is the problem of finding the number of distinct elements in a data
stream with repeated elements. HyperLogLog: an algorithm for the cardinality estimation problem)

In computer science, streaming algorithms are algorithms for processing data streams in which the
input is presented as a sequence of items and can be examined in only a few passes (typically just
one). These algorithms have limited memory available to them (much less than the input size) and
also limited processing time per item.  These constraints may mean that an algorithm produces an
approximate answer based on a summary or "sketch" of the data stream in memory.

CQRS stands for Command Query Responsibility Segregation.

Command–query separation (CQS) is a principle of imperative computer programming.  It states that
every method should either be a command that performs an action, or a query that returns data to the
caller, but not both. In other words, Asking a question should not change the answer. More formally,
methods should return a value only if they are referentially transparent and hence possess no side
effects.
---
traditional: read and update commands are executed against the same set of entities.
CQRS: read commands and update commands are executed against different models: read model and write model.
CQRS can be paired with event sourcing. need to deal with eventual consistency.

traditional approach to distributed transaction: requires 2-phase commit.  alternative: event
sourcing: Rather than store the current state of an entity, the application stores a sequence of
state-changing events. The application reconstructs an entity’s current state by replaying the
events. Since saving an event is a single operation, it is inherently atomic.
event sourcing: Capture all changes to an application state as a sequence of events.
--
event sourcing: persist the state of the application by storing a history of events rather
than as a single snapshot. get an audit trail automatically.

aggregate (from DDD): define consistency boundaries for groups of related entities. a group
of related objects that are treated as a unit for the purpose of data changes.

questions to ask in response to coding questions:
What’s the operating environment?
How fast does it have to be?

OAuth (Open Authorization) is an open standard for token-based authentication and authorization on
the Internet. OAuth, which is pronounced "oh-auth," allows an end user's account information to be
used by third-party services, such as Facebook, without exposing the user's password.
====
OAuth: a delegation protocol. a 3rd-party app requests authorization from the resource
owner, the 3rd-party app then requests a token from the authorization server. the
3rd-party app then uses the token to access the resource.
====
OAuth2: a token-based security framework that allows a user to authenticate themselves with a
third-party authentication service. If the user successfully authenticates, they will be
presented a token that must be sent with every request.

GraphQL is a syntax that describes how to ask for data, and is generally used to load data from a
server to a client. GraphQL has three main characteristics: It lets the client specify exactly what
data it needs.  It makes it easier to aggregate data from multiple sources.  It uses a type system
to describe data.
--
instead of having multiple “dumb” endpoints, have a single “smart” endpoint that can take in complex
queries, and then massage the data output into whatever shape the client requires.

variable: an alias for a memory location.
pointer: store the memory location of a variable

board of directors (B of D) is a group of individuals that are elected as, or elected to act as,
representatives of the stockholders to establish corporate management related policies and to make

Using an identifier before its declaration is called a forward reference, and results in an error

sans-serif font: usually used for heading (in print), (Arial), heading > 12pt
serif font: usually used for body text. (Times New Roman), body: btw 9 & 12 pt

resume: heading: Arial (sans-serif), body text: Times New Roman (serif)

factory vs builder patterns:
Consider a restaurant. The creation of "today's meal" is a factory pattern, because you tell the
kitchen "get me today's meal" and the kitchen (factory) decides what object to generate, based on
hidden criteria.
--
The builder appears if you order a custom pizza. In this case, the waiter tells the chef (builder)
"I need a pizza; add cheese, onions and bacon to it!" Thus, the builder exposes the attributes the
generated object should have, but hides how to set them.

consider builder pattern if the constructor requires a lot of parameters.

A future is a read-only placeholder view of a variable; that is, its role is to contain a value
and nothing more.  A promise is a writable, single-assignment container that sets the value of the
future. Promises may deine an API that can be used to react to a future’s state changes, such as the
value being resolved, the value being rejected due to an error (expected or unexpected), or the
cancelation of the computing task.

Pascal Case. Words created by concatenating capitalized words. An example : PascalCase. Sometimes
called "UpperCamelCase", or "DromedaryCase". Distinguished from CamelCase by the restriction that
the first letter must be upper case.

API versioning:
1. put the version into the URL: http:/host/api/v1/blah
2. Custom request header: You use the same URL as before but add a header such as "api-version: 2"
3. Accept header: You modify the accept header to specify the version, for example
   "Accept: application/vnd.haveibeenpwned.v2+json"

profiling:
a means by which dynamic program behaviors can be measured during a training run with a representative input.
--
profiling is a form of dynamic program analysis that measures, for example, the space (memory) or
time complexity of a program, the usage of particular instructions, or the frequency and duration of
function calls.
--
Profiling is achieved by instrumenting either the program source code or its binary executable form
using a tool called a profiler (or code profiler). Profilers may use a number of different
techniques, such as event-based, statistical, instrumented, and simulation methods.
--
Profilers, which are also programs themselves, analyze target programs by collecting information on
their execution. Based on their data granularity, on how profilers collect information, they are
classified into event based or statistical profilers. Since profilers interrupt program execution to
collect information, they have a finite resolution in the time measurements, which should be taken
with a grain of salt.
--
Event-based profilers: provides hooks to profilers, for trapping events like calls, class-load,
unload, thread enter leave.
Statistical profilers: operate by sampling. A sampling profiler probes the target program's call
stack at regular intervals using operating system interrupts.
--
Profilers use a wide variety of techniques to collect data, including hardware interrupts, code
instrumentation, instruction set simulation, operating system hooks, and performance counters.

a snapshot is the state of a system at a particular point in time
--
A snapshot is a point-in-time copy of data created from a set of markers pointing to stored data and
is effectively a backup.
--
A storage snapshot does not consume any space by default when it is created. It is just a copy of
the metadata that holds information about the data snapped that is used both for tracking purposes
and for saving changes based on the pointer. Storage snapshots are created instantly
--
snapshot is stored at the same location as the original data.

Backups : a point-in-time copy
--
Service levels for backup are described using two metrics – recovery point objective (RPO) and
recovery time objective (RTO).
--
RPO defines the historical point in time to where the backup will be restored. Some applications
require an RPO of zero, but a period of minutes or hours is acceptable in many other
scenarios. Occasionally, it is necessary to restore data from much further back in time, maybe days
or weeks previously.
--
RTO defines the amount of time required to restore backed-up data to the primary system, which could
be measured in minutes or hours but is typically required to be as fast as possible.
--
Continuous data protection (CDP) – CDP is a method of snapshotting that tracks and store all updates
to data as they occur. Theoretically, this means CDP solutions can roll back to any point in time,
down to the smallest granularity of update.

a computer program or subroutine is called reentrant if it can be interrupted in the middle of its
execution, and then be safely called again ("re-entered") before its previous invocations complete
execution. The interruption could be caused by an internal action such as a jump or call, or by an
external action such as an interrupt or signal. Once the reentered invocation completes, the
previous invocations will resume correct execution.

maximum subarray problem: given an array, find a contiguous subarray that has the largest sum.
the array can contain a mix of positive/negative numbers.
maximum subarray problem: Kadane's algorithm. O(n)
dynamic programming approach:
MS(i) = maximum sum ending at index i
for any index:
EITHER add to the solution found up to "i-1"th index
OR start a new sum from the index "i".
--> MS(i) = Max[MS(i-1) + A[i] , A[i]]
--> set initial maximum to be the first element
==
at each index, key question: should I add to the previous sum? or should I start a new sum?
when do I start a new sum? when the (previous sum + element) < element
at each index: two questions:
1. what is the maximum sum at index i?
2. what is the starting index for this sum?
at beginning, the maximum sum is the first element,
starting index for this sum is index 0
==
we start traversing from the second element. from i=1
add the element to the sum.

A subquery is a query that is nested inside a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement, or inside
another subquery. A subquery can be used anywhere an expression is allowed.
==
correlated subquery (also known as a synchronized subquery) is a subquery (a query nested inside
another query) that uses values from the outer query. Because the subquery may be evaluated once for
each row processed by the outer query, it can be inefficient.
---

Key Performance Indicator (KPI) is a measurable value that demonstrates how effectively a company is
achieving key business objectives.

concurrency: when a task is broken down into smaller pieces and run simultaneously.
can be achieved via: (a) multitasking (running multiple processes on the same machine)
(b) multithreading (multiple threads in one process) (c) distribute the work across a grid/cloud
does not require parallelism. time slicing allows threads/processes to run simultaneously.

L1, L2 cache: usually local to the core
L3: shared by multiple cores

cache coherence: when a memory resource is stored in multiple local processor caches, cache
coherence ensures that changes in the value of the shared resource are propagated throughout the system.
cache coherence is the uniformity of shared data that ends up in multiple local caches.
different threads accessing the same data can have private copies of the data in their local caches.
cache coherence protocol: MESI protocol (modified, exclusive, shared, invalid)
coherence mechanism; snooping or directory-based
cache coherence: shared data in multiple local caches have the same value
cache coherence: make sure CPUs agree on the value of each memory location.
==
When using a multi-core processor, hardware-based cache coherency management can cause cache lines
to migrate transparently between cores. This can potentially cause different cores to see updates to
cached memory locations in different order.

Changes in contraction of the ciliary muscles alter the focal distance of the eye, causing nearer or
farther images to come into focus on the retina; this process is known as accommodation
--
the far point is the point at which an object must be placed along the optical axis of the eye for
its image to be focused on the retina when the eye is not accommodating. It is sometimes described
as the farthest point from the eye at which images are clear.
--
For an unaccommodated emmetropic eye, the far point is at infinity, but for the sake of
practicality, infinity is considered to be 6 m because the accommodation change from 6 m to infinity
is negligible.
--
For an unaccommodated myopic eye, the far point is closer than 6 m.
--
Emmetropia is the state of vision where a faraway object at infinity is in sharp focus with the eye
lens in a neutral or relaxed state.

Anisometropia is the condition in which the two eyes have unequal refractive power. Each eye can be
nearsighted (myopia), farsighted (hyperopia) or a combination of both, which is called
antimetropia. Generally a difference in power of two diopters or more is the accepted threshold to
label the condition anisometropia.

In parallel computing, a barrier is a type of synchronization method. A barrier for a group of
threads or processes in the source code means any thread/process must stop at this point and cannot
proceed until all other threads/processes reach this barrier.

When a modern computer reads from or writes to a memory address, it will do this in word sized
chunks (e.g. 4 byte chunks on a 32-bit system) or larger. Data alignment means putting the data at a
memory address equal to some multiple of the word size, which increases the system's performance due
to the way the CPU handles memory. To align the data, it may be necessary to insert some meaningless
bytes between the end of the last data structure and the start of the next, which is data structure
padding.

Memory barriers, or fences, are a set of processor instructions used to apply ordering limitations
on memory operations.
memory fence/barrier: a type of barrier definition that causes a CPU or compiler to enforce an ordering
constraint on memory operations issued before and after the barrier instruction.
--> enforce ordering on memory accesses
This means that operations issued before the barrier and guaranteed to be performed before operations
issued after the barrier.
memory barriers are necessary because CPUs employ performance optimizations that can result in
out-of-order execution. addresses reordering effects at the hardware level.
--
Absent memory fences or serializing instructions, the processor is free to reorder memory accesses.
--
memory fence: which is an instruction (explicit or implicit) to synchronize memory access between multiple threads.
memory fence: make the memory state within a processor visible to other processors
memory fence/barrier: an instruction to synchronize the cache lines on multi-processor
==
Memory barriers provide two properties.  Firstly, they preserve externally visible program order by
ensuring all instructions either side of the barrier appear in the correct program order if observed
from another CPU and, secondly, they make the memory visible by ensuring the data is propagated to
the cache sub-system.
==
A store barrier, “sfence” instruction on x86, forces all store instructions prior to the barrier to
happen before the barrier and have the store buffers flushed to cache for the CPU on which it is
issued.  This will make the program state visible to other CPUs so they can act on it if necessary.
==
A load barrier, “lfence” instruction on x86, forces all load instructions after the barrier to
happen after the barrier and then wait on the load buffer to drain for that CPU.  This makes program
state exposed from other CPUs visible to this CPU before making further progress.
==
A full barrier, "mfence" instruction on x86, is a composite of both load and store barriers
happening on a CPU.
==
In the Java Memory Model a volatile field has a store barrier inserted after a write to it and a
load barrier inserted before a read of it.  Qualified final fields of a class have a store barrier
inserted after their initialisation to ensure these fields are visible once the constructor
completes when a reference to the object is available.
---
a core has load/store buffers between its registers and L1 cache
===
load means transmitting a value from memory (or cache) to a CPU register.
save means transmitting a value from a CPU register to memory (or cache).
==
unless the CPUs share the cache (or have no cache at all), it is possible for their cache systems to
be momentarily our of sync.

data race occurs when: two or more threads in a single process access the same memory location
concurrently, and. at least one of the accesses is for writing, and. the threads are not using any
exclusive locks to control their accesses to that memory.
==
A race condition is a flaw that occurs when the timing or ordering of events affects a program’s
correctness.
race condition: incorrect behavior caused by threads executing code in an unintended order.

double-checked locking is a software design pattern used to reduce the overhead of acquiring a lock
by first testing the locking criterion (the "lock hint") without actually acquiring the lock. Only
if the locking criterion check indicates that locking is required does the actual locking logic
proceed.
==
it is typically used to reduce locking overhead when implementing "lazy initialization" in a
multi-threaded environment, especially as part of the Singleton pattern.
once the initialization has been completed, acquiring and releasing the locks would appear
unnecessary.
===
intent: Allow atomic lazy initialization, regardless of initialization order, and eliminates subsequent locking overhead.

In software engineering, the initialization-on-demand holder (design pattern) idiom is a lazy-loaded
singleton. In all versions of Java, the idiom enables a safe, highly concurrent lazy initialization
with good performance

The Turing test is a test of a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior equivalent to, or
indistinguishable from, that of a human.

Partitioning is the database process where very large tables are divided into multiple smaller
parts. By splitting a large table into smaller, individual tables, queries that access only a
fraction of the data can run faster because there is less data to scan.
==
Partitioning allows a table, index, or index-organized table to be subdivided into smaller pieces,
where each piece of such a database object is called a partition.
==
Partitioning is more a generic term for dividing data across tables or databases. Sharding is one
specific type of partitioning, namely horizontal partitioning. Horizontal partitioning splits one or
more tables by row, usually within a single instance of a schema and a database server.
==
PARTITIONING has two flavors:
   # HORIZONTAL PARTITIONING  == SHARDING
   # VERTICAL PARTITIONING

the producer–consumer problem (also known as the bounded-buffer problem) is a classic example of a
multi-process synchronization problem. The problem describes two processes, the producer and the
consumer, who share a common, fixed-size buffer used as a queue. The producer's job is to generate
data, put it into the buffer, and start again. At the same time, the consumer is consuming the data
(i.e., removing it from the buffer), one piece at a time. The problem is to make sure that the
producer won't try to add data into the buffer if it's full and that the consumer won't try to
remove data from an empty buffer.
==
The solution for the producer is to either go to sleep or discard data if the buffer is full. The
next time the consumer removes an item from the buffer, it notifies the producer, who starts to fill
the buffer again. In the same way, the consumer can go to sleep if it finds the buffer to be
empty. The next time the producer puts data into the buffer, it wakes up the sleeping consumer.

Write combining (WC) is a computer bus technique for allowing data to be combined and temporarily
stored in a buffer — the write combine buffer (WCB) — to be released together later in burst mode
instead of writing (immediately) as single bits or small chunks.
==
If memory has the capability of being write combined, this means that when you are writing to memory
it combines all the writes in a cache line, and then evicts it across the system bus as a block.
Any reads that occur during this write are not guaranteed to occur in the correct sequence in
respect to the writes.  This is called weak ordering, as the ordering isn't guaranteed between the
read and the write. Great for graphics?
==
write combining: multiple writes are combined into one bus transaction.

mutex vs semaphore: Their synchronization semantics are very different:
===
a mutex is locking mechanism used to synchronize access to a resource. Only one task (can be a
thread or process based on OS abstraction) can acquire the mutex. It means there is ownership
associated with mutex, and only the owner can release the lock (mutex).
--> mutexes allow serialization of access to a given resource i.e. multiple threads wait for a lock, one
at a time and as previously said, the thread owns the lock until it is done: only this particular
thread can unlock it.
===
mutex: a lock. ownership concept. can only be released by the thread that had acquired it.
semaphore: a counter whose value represents the number of shared resources. use parking spaces analogy.
different purposes. mutex for locking (mutual exclusion), semaphore for signaling
mutex and binary semaphore are functionally the same.
==
Semaphore is signaling mechanism (“I am done, you can carry on” kind of signal).
a binary semaphore is a counter with value 0 and 1: a task blocking on it until any task does a
sem_post. The semaphore advertises that a resource is available, and it provides the mechanism to
wait until it is signaled as being available.
you can signal semaphore from any other thread?
semaphore is a counter: binary semaphore and counting semaphore
===
a binary semaphore acts like a mutex? functionally the same
a mutex can only be used to maintain atomicity whereas a semaphore can be used for both ordering and
atomicity.
==
fair semaphore: permits are allocated in a first-come, first-serve manner. no cutting in line.

synchronization primitive: spinlock,
==
The spinlock is a low-level synchronization mechanism which in simple words, represents a variable
which can be in two states: acquired or released.
==
The main idea behind spinlock concept is a lock which will be acquired for a very short time.
==
spinlock is a lock which causes a thread trying to acquire it to simply wait in a loop ("spin")
while repeatedly checking if the lock is available. Since the thread remains active but is not
performing a useful task, the use of such a lock is a kind of busy waiting. Once acquired, spinlocks
will usually be held until they are explicitly released, although in some implementations they may
be automatically released if the thread being waited on (that which holds the lock) blocks, or "goes
to sleep".
==
Because they avoid overhead from operating system process rescheduling or context switching,
spinlocks are efficient if threads are likely to be blocked for only short periods. However,
spinlocks become wasteful if held for longer durations, as they may prevent other threads from
running and require rescheduling. The longer a thread holds a lock, the greater the risk that the
thread will be interrupted by the OS scheduler while holding the lock. If this happens, other
threads will be left "spinning" (repeatedly trying to acquire the lock), while the thread holding
the lock is not making progress towards releasing it. The result is an indefinite postponement until
the thread holding the lock can finish and release it.

Data governance (DG) refers to the overall management of the availability, usability, integrity, and
security of the data employed in an enterprise.

SOA governance is a concept used for activities related to exercising control over services in a
service-oriented architecture (SOA)

synchronization: to occur at the same time. synchronization between tasks is where one task
waits to be notified by another task before it can continue execution.

Micro-segmentation is a security technique that enables fine-grained security policies to be
assigned to data center applications, down to the workload level.

Multi-tenancy is an architecture in which a single instance of a software application serves
multiple customers. Each customer is called a tenant. A software-as-a-service (SaaS) provider,
for example, can run one instance of its application on one instance of a database and provide web
access to multiple customers.
Each customer shares the software application and also shares a single database. The data is tagged
in the database as belonging to one customer or another, and the software is smart e1nough to know
who the data belongs to.
==
single tenancy
A single instance of the software and all of the supporting infrastructure serves a single
customer. With single tenancy, each customer has their own independent database and instance of the
software. With this option, there’s essentially no sharing going on. Everyone has their own,
separate from everyone else.
==
A tenant is any application -- either inside or outside the enterprise -- that needs its own secure
and exclusive virtual computing environment. This environment can encompass all or some select
layers of enterprise architecture, from storage to user interface.

In software development, a leaky abstraction is an abstraction that exposes details and limitations
of its underlying implementation to its users that should ideally be hidden away.

priority inversion is a problematic scenario in scheduling in which a high priority task is
indirectly preempted by a lower priority task effectively "inverting" the relative priorities of the
two tasks.
==
The basic idea of the priority inheritance protocol is that when a job blocks one or more
high-priority jobs, it ignores its original priority assignment and executes its critical section at
an elevated priority level.

compiler:
source code -> frontend -> IR (intermediate representation) -> optimizer -> IR -> backend -> machine code
clang is LLVM's frontend for C family of languages
opt is LLVM optimizer tool
11c is LLVM backend tool

memory-mapped devices: they appear to the CPU as if they are just a set of memory locations.

the compiler may rearrange the order of the statements.
the processor may rearrange the execution order of machine instructions
the memory system may rearrange the order in which writes are commited to memory cells.

atomicity: when instructions have indivisible effects.

Speculation can be described simply as the core executing, or beginning to execute, an instruction
before it knows whether that particular instruction should be executed or not. This means that the
result will be available sooner if conditions resolve such that the speculation was correct.

HTML5 Shiv is a JavaScript workaround to enable styling of HTML5 elements in versions of Internet
Explorer prior to version 9, which do not allow unknown elements to be styled without JavaScript.
--
HTML5 shiv: allow older browsers to recognize certain html5 tags. without the shiv, you can still
use them, however, any CSS styling will be lost in non-supportive browsers.

Leet (or "1337"), also known as eleet or leetspeak, is an alternative alphabet for many languages
that is used primarily on the Internet. It uses some characters to replace others in ways that play
on the similarity of their glyphs via reflection or other resemblance. For example, leet spellings
of the word leet include 1337 and l33t; eleet may be spelled 31337 or 3l33t.

In computer science, compare-and-swap (CASing) is an atomic instruction used in multithreading to
achieve synchronization. It compares the contents of a memory location with a given value and, only
if they are the same, modifies the contents of that memory location to a new given value.
CASing: an atomic instruction used as an alternative to locking.
CASing: exchange a value if the previous value matches some expected one.

Progressive Web App (PWA) is a term used to denote web apps that use the latest web
technologies. Progressive web apps are technically regular web pages (or websites) but can appear to
the user like traditional applications or (native) mobile applications.
--
Progressive Web Apps (PWA) are Web Pages or Web Apps that looks like a mobile app, with similar
interactions and navigations.
--
PWAs are web applications that take advantage of the latest technologies to combine the best of web
and native mobile applications. Using a set of open standard technologies such as, service workers,
the app manifest, and cache and push APIs, we can create applications that are platform independent
and deliver app-like user experiences
--
Think of PWAs as websites that act and feel like native apps.

impostor syndrome (also known as impostor phenomenon or fraud syndrome or the impostor experience)
is a concept describing individuals who are marked by an inability to internalize their
accomplishments and a persistent fear of being exposed as a "fraud".

Bootstrap is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JavaScript framework for developing responsive,
mobile-first web sites

bounded queue: having a fixed size

In computer science, a skip list is a data structure that allows fast search within an ordered
sequence of elements. Fast search is made possible by maintaining a linked hierarchy of
subsequences, with each successive subsequence skipping over fewer elements than the previous one.

SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) is a standard security protocol for establishing encrypted links between
a web server and a browser in an online communication.

ABA problem occurs during synchronization, when a location is read twice, has the same value for
both reads, and "value is the same" is used to indicate "nothing has changed". However, another
thread can execute between the two reads and change the value, do other work, then change the value
back, thus fooling the first thread into thinking "nothing has changed" even though the second
thread did work that violates that assumption.

The ABA problem occurs when multiple threads (or processes) accessing shared data interleave. Below
is the sequence of events that will result in the ABA problem:
==
Process P1 reads value A from shared memory
P1 is preempted, allowing process P2 to run
P2 modifies the shared memory value A to value B and back to A before preemption
P1 begins execution again, sees that the shared memory value has not changed and continues.

lock-free programming: threads don't block one another

read-modify-write is a class of atomic operations (such as test-and-set, fetch-and-add, and
compare-and-swap) that both read a memory location and write a new value into it simultaneously,
either with a completely new value or some function of the previous value.

Sequential consistency means that all threads agree on the order in which memory operations
occurred, and that order is consistent with the order of operations in the program source code.

A Commissioner for Oaths is a person who is authorised to verify affidavits, which are statements in
writing and on oath, and other legal documents. A Commissioner for Oaths is appointed by the Chief
Justice and is usually, though not always, a solicitor.

virtual appliance: an image containing an OS and pre-configured software than can be run on
a hypervisor.

NAS (network-attached storage): is a file-level computer data storage server connected to a computer
network providing data access to a heterogeneous group of clients.
==
NAS provides both storage and a file system. This is often contrasted with SAN (Storage Area
Network), which provides only block-based storage and leaves file system concerns on the "client"
side.
==
NAS: appears a network drive to the client OS (single device)
SAN: multiple devices (fault-tolerant): clien OS see it as a local disk
==
One way to loosely conceptualize the difference between a NAS and a SAN is that NAS appears to the
client OS (operating system) as a file server (the client can map network drives to shares on that
server) whereas a disk available through a SAN still appears to the client OS as a disk
==
Storage Area Networks (SANs) and Network Attached Storage (NAS) both provide networked storage
solutions. A NAS is a single storage device that operates on data files, while a SAN is a local
network of multiple devices that operate on disk blocks
===
A SAN accesses data as blocks, while a NAS accesses data as files.

body copy: Main text part of an advertisement or any printed matter (as distinct from the logo,
headline, subheadings, and graphics) that provides the 'meat' of the communication.

A vergence is the simultaneous movement of both eyes in opposite directions to obtain or maintain
single binocular vision.

closure: a function that retains access to the scope that it was created in.

 document database is essentially a key-value database with more features.
Document databases organize documents into groups called collections, which are analogous to the
tables in relational databases. By contrast, key-value databases store all key-value pairs together
in a single namespace, which is analogous to a relational schema.

here document is a file literal or input stream literal

microservices: creating a system from very small, simple services
microservice architecture - is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection
of loosely coupled services, which implement business capabilities.
===
Microservices are small, autonomous services that work together.

exception handling strategy:
1. handle error at the local level, retry or recover
2. else propagate to the higher level (propagate as is or translate exception)

DNS cache poisoning
Injecting false information into the caches of the DNS system so that future requests are diverted
to another site.

man-in-the-middle attack
==
An unauthorized interception of network traffic. The packets are viewed or modified by the
perpetrator and sent on to the recipient, who is unaware of the intrusion. A man-in-the-middle
attack can be used to intercept an encrypted message exchange and spoof the recipient into thinking
the message is intact from a legitimate sender. In such a case, the attackers replace the public key
from the original sender with their own public key in order to decrypt the message that will be sent
back from the unsuspecting recipient.

diode test
1. A good forward-based diode displays a voltage drop ranging from 0.5 to 0.8 volts for the most
commonly used silicon diodes.
2. The multimeter displays OL when a good diode is reverse-biased. The OL reading indicates the diode
is functioning as an open switch.
3. A bad (opened) diode does not allow current to flow in either direction. A multimeter will display
OL in both directions when the diode is opened.
4. A shorted diode has the same voltage drop reading (approximately 0.4 V) in both directions.
5. The forward-biased resistance of a good diode should range from 1000 Ω to 10 MΩ.
6. The resistance measurement is high when the diode is forward-biased because current from the
multimeter flows through the diode, causing the high-resistance measurement required for testing.
7. The reverse-biased resistance of a good diode displays OL on a multimeter. The diode is bad if
readings are the same in both directions.

back-pressure: the feedback from a subscriber under stress to its publisher
so that the publisher can reduce its load.
--
Back pressure describes the build-up of data, when the incoming task rate is higher than the
system’s ability to process them -- resulting in a buffer of unhandled data.
--
consider fast publisher vs slow subscriber
fast publisher will send at-most 3 elements. this is pull-based back pressure.
---
the idea behind backpressure is the ability to say "hey slow down!"
---
backpressure is signaled up to the source when the buffer becomes full
==
When an asynchronous consumer subscribes to receive messages from a producer, it will typically
provide some form of callback method to be invoked whenever a new message becomes available. If the
producer emits messages at a higher rate than the consumer can handle, the consumer could be forced
to seize an increasing amount of resources and potentially crash. In order to prevent this, a
mechanism is needed by which consumers can notify producers that the message rate needs to be
reduced. Producers can then adopt one of multiple strategies to achieve this. This mechanism is
called back pressure.
==
The way to achieve non-blocking back pressure is to move from a push strategy, where the producer
sends messages to the consumer as soon as these are available, to a pull strategy, where the
consumer requests a number of messages to the producer and this sends only up to this amount,
waiting for further requests before sending any more.
--
subscriber can establish 'reactive pull' backpressure
---
back pressure: a mechanism by which a consumer notifies the producer to reduce its message rate.
--
back pressure is a way to ensure a fast publisher doesn’t overwhelm a slow subscriber
--
Back pressure provides resilience by ensuring that all participants in a stream-based system
participate in flow control to ensure steady state of operation and graceful degradation.
--
Reactive Streams is effectively push-based. It has a single mode of operation, which works like a
pull-based system when the subscriber is slower and a push-based system when the subscriber is
faster.

In web development, a polyfill is code that implements a feature on web browsers that do not support
the feature. Most often, it refers to a JavaScript library that implements an HTML5 web standard,
either an established standard (supported by some browsers) on older browsers, or a proposed
standard (not supported by any browsers) on existing browsers. Formally, "a polyfill is a shim for a
browser API".
===
Polyfills allow web developers to use an API regardless of whether it is supported by a browser or
not, and usually with minimal overhead. Typically they first check if a browser supports an API, and
use it if available, otherwise using their own implementation.

location transparency is the use of names to identify network resources, rather than their actual
location. For example, files are accessed by a unique file name, but the actual data is stored in
physical sectors scattered around a disk in either the local computer or in a network. In a location
transparency system, the actual location where the file is stored doesn't matter to the user.
---
location transparency: the ability to communicate with a resource regardless of its location
(local, remote, networked)

The triboelectric effect (also known as triboelectric charging) is a type of contact electrification
in which certain materials become electrically charged after they come into frictional contact with
a different material.

Neil Günter’s Universal Scalability Law is an essential tool in understanding the effects of
contention and coordination in concurrent and distributed systems, and shows that the cost of
coherency in a system can lead to negative results, as new resources are added to the system.

A namespace is a declarative region that provides a scope to the identifiers (the names of types,
functions, variables, etc) inside it. Namespaces are used to organize code into logical groups and
to prevent name collisions.
==
A namespace in computer science (sometimes also called a name scope), is an abstract container or
environment created to hold a logical grouping of unique identifiers or symbols (i.e. names). An
identifier defined in a namespace is associated only with that namespace.

All the sectors on a disk platter that can be read without moving the head constitute a track. Disks
usually have more than one platter. The collection of tracks on the various platters that can be
read without moving the head is called a cylinder. The geometry of a hard drive is expressed in
cylinders, tracks (or heads) per cylinder, and sectors/track.

configuration management: the process for establishing and maintaining the consistency
of a system

In a brownfield project the structure would need to be demolished or renovated. Today, the term
brownfield project is used in many industries, including software development, to mean to start a
project based on prior work or to rebuild (engineer) a product from an existing one.
greenfield project: a project not constrained by prior work.

Bandwidth throttling is the intentional slowing of Internet service by an Internet service provider.

In software, a throttling process, or a throttling controller as it is sometimes called, is a
process responsible for regulating the rate at which application processing is conducted, either
statically or dynamically.

Streams are a series of elements emitted over time.

reactive systems: a set of architectural design principles.
reactive manifesto: responsive, resilient, elastic, message-driven
A responsive application is both elastic and resilient.
A responsive system is quick to react to all users
--
message-driven application may be event-driven, actor-based, or a combination of the two.
--
An event-driven system is based on events which are monitored by zero or more observers. This is
different than imperative programming because the caller doesn’t need to block waiting for a
response from the invoked routine. Events are not directed to a specific address, but rather watched
(or listened) for
--
Actor-based concurrency is an extension of the message-passing architecture, where messages are
directed to a recipient, which happens to be an actor. Messages may cross thread boundaries or be
passed to another actor’s mailbox on a different physical server.
--
The main difference between messages and events is that messages are directed while events
happen. Messages have a clear destination while events may be observed by zero or more (0-N)
observers
--
The big difference between event-driven and imperative style is that the caller does not block and
hold onto a thread while waiting for a response.
==
A message is an item of data that is sent to a specific destination. An event is a signal emitted by
a component upon reaching a given state. In a message-driven system addressable recipients await the
arrival of messages and react to them, otherwise lying dormant. In an event-driven system
notification listeners are attached to the sources of events such that they are invoked when the
event is emitted. This means that an event-driven system focuses on addressable event sources while
a message-driven system concentrates on addressable recipients.
==
message has a clear destination. events are just facts for others to observe.

decoupling in time allows for concurrency.
decoupling in space allows for distribution and mobility.

Callback hell occurs because the recipients of messages are anonymous callbacks instead of
addressable recipients. Common solutions to callback hell focus purely on the syntactic
aspect — aka, the Pyramid of Doom
--
the pyramid of doom is a common problem that arises when a program uses many levels of nested
indentation to control access to a function. It is commonly seen when checking for null pointers or
handling callbacks

Actor-based applications revolve around asynchronous message passing between multiple actors.
--
An actor is a construct with the following properties:
A mailbox for receiving messages.
The actor’s logic, which relies on pattern matching to determine how to handle each type of message it receives.
Isolated state — rather than shared state — for storing context between requests.

Web Components consists of several separate technologies. You can think of Web Components as
reusable user interface widgets that are created using open Web technology.
--
Web Components are a set of features currently being added by the W3C to the HTML and DOM
specifications that allow for the creation of reusable widgets or components in web documents and
web applications. The intention behind them is to bring component-based software engineering to the
World Wide Web. The components model allows for encapsulation and interoperability
of individual HTML elements.
--
Web Components consist of 4 main features which can be used separately or all together:
--
Custom Elements - APIs to define new HTML elements
Shadow DOM - Encapsulated DOM and styling, with composition
HTML Imports - Declarative methods of importing HTML documents into other documents
HTML Templates - The <template> element, which allows documents to contain inert chunks of DOM

In computer programming, a rope, or cord, is a data structure composed of smaller strings that is
used to efficiently store and manipulate a very long string. For example, a text editing program may
use a rope to represent the text being edited, so that operations such as insertion, deletion, and
random access can be done efficiently.

Photopsia is the presence of perceived flashes of light

Developers focused on nothing more than code and operations focused on taking that code and making
sure it stayed running.

Smalltalk, like Lisp, runs in the same context it’s written in.
Lisp is powerful because all Lisp programs are also Lisp data–everything that can be run can be
written (and read) as an s-expression.

how to catch a liar:
After they tell their story, go over it with them again in the form of questions (e.g., “And what
did you do when you got out of the car?”) but do it backwards from the end of the story to the
beginning.

buffering strategies:
Characters written to or read from an unbuffered stream are transmitted individually to or from the file as soon as possible.
Characters written to a line buffered stream are transmitted to the file in blocks when a newline character is encountered.
Characters written to or read from a fully buffered stream are transmitted to or from the file in blocks of arbitrary size.
==
Characters that are written to a stream are normally accumulated and transmitted asynchronously to
the file in a block, instead of appearing as soon as they are output by the application
program. Similarly, streams often retrieve input from the host environment in blocks rather than on
a character-by-character basis. This is called buffering.

Clock drift means the clock does not run at exactly the same rate as a reference clock.

TDD:
unit: test method in a class

system integration: test interaction between systems

RAII : Resource acquisition is initialization (C++)
is a programming idiom used in several object-oriented languages. In RAII, holding a resource is
a class invariant, and is tied to object lifetime: resource allocation (or acquisition) is done
during object creation (specifically initialization), by the constructor, while resource
deallocation (release) is done during object destruction (specifically finalization), by the
destructor.
==
They should be acquired on construction and released on destruction

isolate the blocking behavior onto a different thread pool that is dedicated for such blocking
operations. We refer to this technique as sandboxing or bulkheading.

Acrophony is the naming of letters of an alphabetic writing system so that a letter's name begins
with the letter itself. For example, Greek letter names are acrophonic.

In linguistics, a grapheme is the smallest unit of a writing system of any given language.
Graphemes include alphabetic letters, typographic ligatures, Chinese characters, numerical digits,
punctuation marks, and other individual symbols.

A LEFT OUTER JOIN is one of the JOIN operations that allow you to specify a join clause. It
preserves the unmatched rows from the first (left) table, joining them with a NULL row in the shape
of the second (right) table.
Example:
select author_last_name, book_key from author left outer join book_author using (author_key)
#author is on the left, that means we get all the rows in the author table

Pulse-code modulation (PCM) is a method used to digitally represent sampled analog signals.

Fundamental Attribution Error: People’s tendency to overemphasize internal explanations for the
behavior of others, while failing to take into account the power of the situation.
==
When we are trying to understand and explain what happens in social settings, we tend to view
behavior as a particularly significant factor. We then tend to explain behavior in terms of internal
disposition, such as personality traits, abilities, motives, etc. as opposed to external situational
factors.

A function is idempotent if reapplying it does not produce a different result.

Point-Free Style: Writing functions where the definition does not explicitly identify the arguments
used.

A contract specifies the obligations and guarantees of the behavior from a function or expression at
runtime. This acts as a set of rules that are expected from the input and output of a function or
expression, and errors are generally reported whenever a contract is violated.

LL/SC: load-link and store-conditional: load-link reads a value from a given address.
store-conditional: write the value only if no other stores were made to that address since
the corresponding load-link.

Sequential consistency : the result of any execution is the same as if the operations of all the
processors were executed in some sequential order, and the operations of each individual processor
appear in this sequence in the order specified by its program.
==
To understand this statement, it is essential to understand one key property of sequential
consistency: execution order of program in the same processor (or thread) is the same as the program
order, while execution order of program between processors (or threads) is undefined. In an example
like this:
==
Sequential consistency requires that a shared memory multiprocessor appear to be a multiprogramming
uniprocessor system to any program running on it.

compiler/hardware optimization:
reorder code: to avoid pipeline stalls,
to improve locality (put variables on the same cache line).
variable can be assigned to the same memory location.
instructions can be executed speculatively before a branch is taken, then undone if guessed incorrectly.

acquire and release semantics
all read and write operations can not be moved before an acquire operation, all read and write
operations can not be move behind a release operation.

Hybrid cloud is a cloud computing environment which uses a mix of on-premises, private cloud and
third-party, public cloud services with orchestration between the two platforms.
==
A hybrid cloud is an integrated cloud service utilising both private and public clouds to perform
distinct functions within the same organisation.

cloud migration strategies:

Elon Musk interview question:
Tell me about some of the most difficult problems you worked on and how you solved them.

Big O: how long does it take to execute a given algorightm?
computer scientists don’t give the answer in minutes or milliseconds; they give it relative to the
number of elements the algorithm has to manipulate.

A mathematical expression that involves N’s and N^2s and N’s raised to other powers is called a
polynomial, and that’s what the “P” in “P = NP” stands for. P is the set of problems whose solution
times are proportional to polynomials involving N's.

Network Function Virtualization (NFV): NFV decouples the network functions, such as router,
firewall, IPS and WAN optimizer, from proprietary hardware appliances so that the network functions
become hardware agnostic and can be deployed, changed and upgraded quickly.
==
NFV is about virtualizing IT resources in software so that virtual implementations may be used to
provide important network functions, rather than requiring the presence of one or more specialized
physical devices.

SDN: Separating Network Control Logic from Network Hardware
The guiding principle behind SDN remains the separation of network control logic from the physical
routers and switches that forward traffic from individual network nodes
==
this means SDN control software sits atop a physical infrastructure layer composed of networking
devices, with which it communicates via a control plane interface such as OpenFlow
===
traditional switch: control and data functions are integrated on the device.
control function (aka control plane): refers to packet-forwarding rules.
data function (aka data plane): forwards packets
SDN approach: control functions are moved out of the switches and into SDN controllers.
switches are just packet-forwarding devices. SDN controller defines the data flows that occur
in the data plane. each switch must implement a model of packet forwarding and present
an API to SDN controllers. example: OpenFlow

============ P/NP/NP-complete/NP-hard==========
decision problem: a problem with a yes/no answer
--
P is a complexity class that represents the set of all decision problems that can be solved in
polynomial time.
--
NP is a complexity class that represents the set of all decision problems whose solutions that can
be verified in polynomial time.
====
NP-Complete is a complexity class which represents the set of all problems X in NP for which it is
possible to reduce any other NP problem Y to X in polynomial time. NP-complete is the hardest NP
problems.

Intuitively this means that we can solve Y quickly if we know how to solve X quickly. Precisely, Y
is reducible to X, if there is a polynomial time algorithm f to transform instances y of Y to
instances x = f(y) of X in polynomial time, with the property that the answer to y is yes, if and
only if the answer to f(y) is yes.

3-SAT. This is the problem wherein we are given a conjunction (ANDs) of 3-clause disjunctions (ORs),
statements of the form

(x_v11 OR x_v21 OR x_v31) AND
(x_v12 OR x_v22 OR x_v32) AND
...                       AND
(x_v1n OR x_v2n OR x_v3n)
where each x_vij is a boolean variable or the negation of a variable from a finite predefined list (x_1, x_2, ... x_n).

It can be shown that every NP problem can be reduced to 3-SAT. The proof of this is technical and
requires use of the technical definition of NP (based on non-deterministic Turing machines). This is
known as Cook's theorem.

What makes NP-complete problems important is that if a deterministic polynomial time algorithm can
be found to solve one of them, every NP problem is solvable in polynomial time (one problem to rule
them all).
====
NP-hard

Intuitively, these are the problems that are at least as hard as the NP-complete problems. Note that
NP-hard problems do not have to be in NP, and they do not have to be decision problems.

The precise definition here is that a problem X is NP-hard, if there is an NP-complete problem Y,
such that Y is reducible to X in polynomial time.

But since any NP-complete problem can be reduced to any other NP-complete problem in polynomial
time, all NP-complete problems can be reduced to any NP-hard problem in polynomial time. Then, if
there is a solution to one NP-hard problem in polynomial time, there is a solution to all NP
problems in polynomial time.

The halting problem is an NP-hard problem. This is the problem that given a program P and input I,
will it halt? This is a decision problem but it is not in NP. It is clear that any NP-complete
problem can be reduced to this one. As another example, any NP-complete problem is NP-hard.

polynomial: an expression consisting of variables (also called indeterminates) and coefficients,
that involves only the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and non-negative integer
exponents of variables. example: x^2 - 4x + 7

f(x1,x2,...xn) = b + a1x1 + a2x2 +... anxn : the graph is a hyperplane of dimension n

Mesentery: In general, a fold of tissue that attaches organs to the body wall. The word mesentery
usually refers to the small bowel mesentery, which anchors the small intestines to the back of the
abdominal wall. Blood vessels, nerves, and lymphatics branch through the mesentery to supply the
intestine.

juices and partly digested food.

CPU profilers: sampling and tracing profilers.
Tracing profilers record every function call your program makes and then print out a report at the
end. Sampling profilers take a more statistical approach – they record your program’s stack every
few milliseconds and then report the results.

A time series is a series of data points indexed in time order. Most commonly, a time series is a
sequence taken at successive equally spaced points in time. Thus it is a sequence of discrete-time

In automotive engineering, the master cylinder is a control device that converts non-hydraulic
pressure (commonly from a driver's foot) into hydraulic pressure. This device controls slave
cylinders located at the other end of the hydraulic system.

slave cylinder works together with the clutch master cylinder to disengage the clutch when the pedal
is pressed so that the transmission can be safely shifted. The clutch slave cylinder receives
pressure from the master cylinder and extends a rod, which will push against a fork or lever to
disengage the clutch.

The UTF-8 BOM is a sequence of bytes (EF BB BF) that allows the reader to identify a file as being
encoded in UTF-8.  Normally, the BOM is used to signal the endianness of an encoding, but since
endianness is irrelevant to UTF-8, the BOM is unnecessary.

Each gear has an effective operating range of speeds which depend on the rev range of the
engine. The faster the engine rotates, the quicker you can go up to the point when you need to
change up a gear. Within the operational rotational speeds of the engine, there is a range of
optimum efficiency known as the ‘power band’, and this is where the fastest acceleration can be
obtained.
--
Most gearboxes are designed so that when you change up a gear when accelerating, the next gear will
be at or near the start of the engine’s power band. This design provides maximum acceleration all
the way up to the top speed of the car.
--
Lower gears provide greater acceleration due to the mechanical advantage of the gearing and the
higher engine speeds.
--
When approaching a corner, you need to select a gear which will provide maximum acceleration at the
exit, and this gear needs to be engaged before entering the corner. This means braking to the speed
where you can safely turn into the bend, then shifting before turning in. Ideally you’ll need to
select a gear which will cause the engine speed to increase to a sensible point within the power
band so that plenty of power is available when accelerating out of the turn for that quick exit.
--
However if you select the correct gear and let out the clutch swiftly, three things will happen:
--
Significant levels of engine braking will occur.
In extreme cases, the wheels can lock up (image selecting second gear at 80 mph
and dumping the clutch).
A forward weight transfer will occur
--
Rev matching is used when down-shifting to smooth the transition between gears, and prevent shock
loads through the transmission.

A rev limiter is a device fitted in modern vehicles that have internal combustion engines. They are
intended to protect an engine by restricting it's maximum rotational speed, measured in revolutions
per minute (RPM).

Double clutching is technically what is done to speed up a transmission that is not synchronized so
that it's possible to shift gears. Accelerate, clutch, move to neutral, release clutch, trans gears
spin up, clutch, move to next gear.

So, solving an (minimization) optimization problem amounts to meet two conditions:
1. Find x in P
2. Such that for all y in P, f(x) <= f(y)
--
In such case we say that x is a solution to the problem.  If x only meets condition 1 then x is
called a feasible solution.
--
Depending on P and f, condition 2 can be much harder than condition 1.  We call it proving
optimality.
--
if you find a lower bound on all possible values of the objective function, i.e. a number L such
that for all y in P, L <= f(y)
--
then you can evaluate how good is your x.  You compute the gap as follow: gap = (f(x) - L)/ f(x)
==
If gap = 0, then you know that condition 2 above is true, hence your x is the solution you are
looking for.  If the gap is non zero, then you know you may get a better x by working longer on your
problem.  You also know that if there is a better x it cannot be better by more than the gap.
Hence, the smaller the gap, the better.  Note that gap may be computed slightly differently in
practice, if only to deal with the case where f(x) = 0.  But the two properties stay:
==
If the gap is zero then you have solved the problem, i.e. both condition 1 and 2 above are true.  If
the gap is larger than 0, the smaller the gap the better x is

A slack or surplus value is reported for each of the constraints. The term "slack" applies to less
than or equal constraints, and the term "surplus" applies to greater than or equal constraints. If a
constraint is binding, then the corresponding slack or surplus value will equal zero.
A constraint is binding if the constraint becomes an equality when the solution values are substituted.
==
Constraints exist because certain limitations restrict the range of a variable's possible values. A
constraint is considered to be binding if changing it also changes the optimal solution. Less severe
constraints that do not affect the optimal solution are non-binding.
==
Graphically, binding constraints are constraints where the optimal solution lies exactly on the line
representing that constraint.

In an optimization problem, a slack variable is a variable that is added to an inequality constraint
to transform it into an equality. Introducing a slack variable replaces an inequality constraint
with an equality constraint and a non-negativity constraint on the slack variable.  As with the
other variables in the augmented constraints, the slack variable cannot take on negative values.
example, Ax <= b can be converted to Ax+y=b (y>=0)

original: x+4y<=6, standard form: x+4y+s1=6 (s1: slack variable, s1>=0)
original: 4x+2y>=20, standard form: 4x+2y-s1=20 (s1: surplus variable, s1>=0)
slack variable: apply to <= constraint
surplus variable: apply to >= constraint

If all of the unknown variables are required to be integers, then the problem is called an integer
programming (IP) or integer linear programming (ILP) problem. In contrast to linear programming,
which can be solved efficiently in the worst case, integer programming problems are in many
practical situations (those with bounded variables) NP-hard. 0-1 integer programming or binary
integer programming (BIP) is the special case of integer programming where variables are required to
be 0 or 1 (rather than arbitrary integers).
--
If only some of the unknown variables are required to be integers, then the problem is called a
mixed integer programming (MIP) problem.

the feasible region of an LP is the region delimited by the constraints, and it represents all
feasible solutions.

Operations research is a discipline that deals with the application of advanced analytical methods

combinatorial optimization is a topic that consists of finding an optimal object from a finite set
of objects. Integer programming nowadays is often called combinatorial optimisation
==
An optimization problem with discrete variables is known as a combinatorial optimization problem. In
a combinatorial optimization problem, we are looking for an object such as an integer, permutation
or graph from a finite (or possibly countably infinite) set. Problems with continuous variables
include constrained problems and multimodal problems.
==
optimization problem is the problem of finding the best solution from all feasible solutions.

For any IP we can generate an LP (called the LP relaxation) from the IP by taking the same objective
function and same constraints but with the requirement that variables are integer replaced by
appropriate continuous constraints.
e.g. xi = 0 or 1 can be replaced by the two continuous constraints xi >= 0 and xi <= 1

An algorithm is typically deterministic and proven to yield an optimal result
A heuristic has no proof of correctness, often involves random elements, and may not yield optimal results.
Heuristic, in a nutshell is an "Educated guess"
--
a heuristic is a procedure that tries to produce good or approximate solutions to a problem quickly
but which lacks theoretical guarantees.

side-channel attack is any attack based on information gained from the physical implementation of a
cryptosystem, rather than brute force or theoretical weaknesses in the algorithms (compare
cryptanalysis). For example, timing information, power consumption, electromagnetic leaks or even
sound can provide an extra source of information, which can be exploited to break the system.

Branch and cut is a method of combinatorial optimization for solving integer linear programs (ILPs),
that is, linear programming (LP) problems where some or all the unknowns are restricted to integer
values. Branch and cut involves running a branch and bound algorithm and using cutting planes to
tighten the linear programming relaxations. Note that if cuts are only used to tighten the initial
LP relaxation, the algorithm is called cut and branch.

branch and bound: solve the LP relaxation of the problem first.
create a tree where the root node is the LP relaxation of the original problem
and the nodes represent subproblems.

an enumeration tree of all possible variable settings is partially traversed, computing local upper
bounds and global lower bounds, which are used to avoid parts of the tree that cannot produce the
optimal value.

marginal cost: the cost added by producing one additional unit of a product or service.

Multi-objective optimization: involving more than one objective function to be optimized simultaneously.
==
For a nontrivial multi-objective optimization problem, no single solution exists that simultaneously
optimizes each objective. In that case, the objective functions are said to be conflicting, and
there exists a (possibly infinite) number of Pareto optimal solutions.
A solution is called nondominated, Pareto optimal, Pareto efficient or noninferior, if none of the
objective functions can be improved in value without degrading some of the other objective values.

goal programming:
each objective is given a target value to be achieved.
Achieve target levels of each objective rather than maximized or minimized levels

preemptive/lexicographic method:
Perform the optimization by considering one objective at a time, based on priorities.
the optimal objective value of an objective is then used as a constraint in subsequent objective.
Each LP is optimized one at a time such that the optimum value of a higher priority objective is not
degraded by a lower priority objective. This can be achieved by either adding the previous objective
as a constraint to the successive model or looking at the reduced cost for each solved model.
each successive model would thereby consist of an extra constraint and avoid degradation of the
previous solution.
==
In this method, the objectives are ranked in order of importance by the decision maker (from best to
worst). The optimal value f(i) (i = 1, . . . , k) is then obtained by minimizing the objective
functions sequentially, starting with the most important one and proceeding according to the order
of importance of the objectives. Additionally, the optimal value found of each objective is added as
a constraint for subsequent optimizations.
==
1. min f1(x),
2. min f2(x), s.t. f1(x) <= y1
3. min f3(x), s.t. f1(x) <= y1, f2(x) <= y2

Affordances are clues about how an object should be used, typically provided by the object itself or
its context. For example, even if you've never seen a coffee mug before, its use is fairly
natural. The handle is shaped for easy grasping and the vessel has a large opening at the top with
an empty well inside.

BCO: beneficial cargo owner: an importer that takes control of their cargo at the point of entry and
does not utilize a third party source like like an NVOCC or Freight Forwarder. Typically, BCOs are
large companies that import products regularly, thus, they have an in-house department for import
procedures. The easiest examples of BCO’s are your large retailers like Walmart, Target, Best Buy.

A Non Vessel Operating Common Carrier is a cargo consolidator who does not own any vessel, but acts
as a carrier legally by accepting required responsibilities of a carrier who issues his own bill of
lading (or airway bill), which is called House bill of lading under sea shipment and House airway
bill under air shipment.  Activities between a NVOCC and a Freight Forwarder are similar to each
other except some differences. An NVOCC need not be an agent or partner of a Freight Forwarding
company, whereas a Freight Forwarding company can act as a partner or agent for an NVOCC.
NVOCC acts a carrier to shipper and shipper to carrier.
An NVOCC acts as the carrier while a Freight Forwarder does not
An NVOCC issues a bill of lading while a Freight Forwarder does not

Selenium is a portable software-testing framework for web applications.

An out-of-process component is an .exe file that runs in its own process, with its own thread of
execution. Communication between a client and an out-of-process component is therefore called
cross-process or out-of-process communication.
==
An in-process component, such as a .dll or .ocx file, runs in the same process as the client. It
provides the fastest way of accessing objects, because property and method calls don’t have to be
marshaled across process boundaries. However, an in-process component must use the client’s thread
of execution.

in computer networking, the multicast Domain Name System (mDNS) protocol resolves host names to IP
addresses within small networks that do not include a local name server. It is a zero-configuration
service
Multicast DNS provides name-to-address translation and other DNS-like operations in the absence of a
conventional DNS server

The zero-conf specification covers three broad goals:
Allow devices to obtain an IP address even in the absence of a DHCP server.
Allow devices to obtain a hostname, even in the absence of a DNS server.
Allow devices to advertise and search for (discover) services on the local link.
1. if no DHCP server, use link-local addressing to obtain an IP address
The address assigned by link-local addressing is in the 169.254.0.0/16 block, which is only useful
within the link (because routers won’t forward packets from devices in this address space[
--
To obtain an address the device sends ARP requests to establish whether its desired IP address
(chosen at random from the 169.254 range) is available. This is a two-step process:
--
First, an ARP probe is sent asking for the MAC address of the machine with a given IP. This probe is
sent a number of times to confirm that the given IP address is not in use (there will be no response
if it isn’t).  If no reply is received, the device sends out an ARP announcement saying that it is
now the machine with the given IP.
===
2. Assigning as hostname is simple if you have a DNS server, but, if you don’t, zero-conf can assign
hostnames using Multicast DNS.
To claim a local hostname with mDNS, a device sends DNS messages to probe for the uniqueness of the
hostname. Three queries are sent in 250ms intervals, and if no device reports using this hostname,
the requesting device then sends an announce message to claim ownership.
==
3. DNS Service Discovery (also known as DNS-SD) can be used to search for services available on the
local link. service:
ServiceType.Domain
InstanceName.ServiceType.Domain
example: jose._ipp._tcp.local #jose is the name of the printer
==
DNS-SD uses mDNS to announce the presence of services. To achieve this, it uses DNS PTR and SRV
records.
===
Zeroconf (zero configuration networking) refers to several protocols and techniques that are used
together to create an IP (Internet Protocol) network with no special configuration servers or manual
operator intervention. These networks allow novices to connect computers, network devices, scanners,
and printers to create a functioning network without requiring manual configuration. Zeroconf does
not require the user to set up Domain Name System services (DNS), Dynamic Host Configuration
Protocol (DHCP), or manually configure the computer’s network settings.
==
The three primary technologies that comprise a zeroconf network are automatic resolution and
distribution of computer host names (referred to as multicast DNS), numeric network addresses
assigned to networked devices (link-local address auto-configuration), and automatic location of
network services.
==
Zerconf uses a number of underlying technologies. For address selection, link-local addressing
replaces the DHCP server. This capability is built into Ipv6 addresses. However, traditional Ipv4 is
used as a last resort except in a zeroconf context. The multicast name service is used for name
resolution in zeroconf in order to allow a network device to select a domain name in the local name
space and then announce it using a designated multicast IP address. Zeroconf uses multicast DNS for
service discovery. In this model, every computer on the local network stores an individual listing
of DNS resource records and then joins the respective DNS multicast group supporting the zeroconf
network.

consensus mechanism: proof-of-work, proof-of-stake, proof-of-authority, delegated proof-of-stake
==
proof-of-work: solve crypto-puzzles using dedicated hardware.
==
proof-of-stake: In this system we have validators instead of miners. The way it works is that as a
validator, you will first have to lock up some of your ether as stake. After doing that you will
then start validating blocks which basically means that if you see any blocks that you think can be
appended to the blockchain, you can validate it by placing a bet on it. When and if, the block gets
appended, you will get a reward proportional to the stake you have invested. If, however, you bet on
the wrong or the malicious block, the stake that you have invested will be taken away from you.

elasticity: the ability to spin up computing resources quickly for a short time and
then spin down the resources when they are no longer needed.
elasticity: the ability to scale up/down to meet varying demands.

LEFT OUTER JOIN. This type of join returns all rows from the LEFT-hand table specified in the ON
condition and only those rows from the other table where the joined fields are equal (join condition
is met).
example:
SELECT columns
FROM table1
LEFT [OUTER] JOIN table2
ON table1.column = table2.column;
--> table1 is the left-hand table

Join: inner join is the intersection between 2 tables. It returns one row for each pair of matching
rows in the tables being joined. Outer join: a join operation in which all source records are
included in the result, even those that don’t satisfy the join condition.  Outer join: extends the
result of an inner join by including rows from one table that don’t have corresponding rows in
another table. Cross join (cartesian product): combine every row in table A with every row in table
B. Cross join: always M*N rows. Full outer join: from max(M,N) to (M+N) rows.

Referential integrity in a relational database is consistency between coupled tables. Referential
integrity is usually enforced by the combination of a primary key and a foreign key. Columns in a
table that refer to the primary keys of another table are known as foreign keys. One-to-many
relationship: place a foreign key in the table representing the many, pointing to the primary key of
the table representing the one.

Quality of experience: delivering the level of service the customers believe they
should receive

OAuth: open authorization: a process through which an application can access private user data
from another website.

bounded context: define a boundary between sub-domains.
==
Bounded contexts enclose the meanings and responsibilities of some part of the domain. A specific
domain entity contained in a bounded context could be a customer, for example. The boundaries,
responsibilities, and possible overlaps of bounded contexts are defined in a context map of the
system.  In the model of microservices, a bounded context would typically result in a single deploy-
able application.

Value objects are business domain types that do not represent identifiable types but rather spe-
cific values. For these domain objects, it doesn’t matter which instance will be used inside the
business process. Examples of value objects are addresses, money values, or Java enums. Value
objects ideally are immutable and, therefore, reusable.

Services are responsible for performing domain business logic that is not naturally part of an
entity or value object. They are entry points of the business use cases that manage and orches-
trate domain entities, and they hold together the separate steps of the business process.  In a Java
EE world, services are implemented as managed beans—either Contexts and Dependency Injection (CDI)
beans or EJB beans.

aggregate: a root object and its children that are manipulated as a single unit.

backing service: any service consumed by an app is called a backing service.

lexically scoped: the variable does not exist outside the scope in which it is defined.

web service: program-to-program interaction via HTTP

template language: the language is embedded within some other master document

data types can be divided into two categories: value types and reference types. A value of value
type is the actual value. A value of reference type is a reference to another value.
==
variables that are based on value types directly contain values. Assigning one value type variable
to another copies the contained value. This differs from the assignment of reference type variables,
which copies a reference to the object but not the object itself.

geo-fence: a virtual perimeter around a geographical location. when a mobile device crosses
the geo-fence, actions can be taken by an application.

caching strategies:
Cache-Aside , Read-Through , Write-Through , Write-Around , Write-Back

RAID 0 (disk striping) is the process of dividing a body of data into blocks and spreading the data
blocks across multiple storage devices, such as hard disks or solid-state drives (SSDs), in a
redundant array of independent disks (RAID) group. A stripe consists of the data divided across the
set of hard disks or SSDs, and a striped unit refers to the data slice on an individual drive.
--> dividing a file in half, storing one half in one disk and the other half in another disk.

A programming language or programming-language construct is type-safe if it forbids operations that
are incorrect for the types on which they operate.

A static type system is sound if it guarantees that operations that are incorrect for a type will
not be performed; otherwise it is unsound.  Haskell has a sound type system. The type system of C
(and thus C++) is unsound, since there is always a way of treating a value of one type as if it has
a different type.

post/redirect/get pattern: prevents some duplicate form submissions.  When a web form is submitted
to a server through an HTTP POST request, a web user that attempts to refresh the server response in
certain user agents can cause the contents of the original POST request to be resubmitted, possibly
causing undesired results, such as a duplicate web purchase.  To avoid this problem, instead of
returning a web page directly, the POST operation returns a redirection command. The HTTP 1.1
specification introduced the HTTP 303 ("See other") response code to ensure that in this situation,
the web user's browser can safely refresh the server response without causing the initial POST
request to be resubmitted.
double submission problem can still happen if the user refreshes the page before the initial
submission has completed.

point of presence: the interface point between communicating entities

end point: the interface exposed by communicating entities.

webhook: the end point URL provided by a client-side application to a server-side application.
the server will call the webhook URL when an event occurs on the server.

hot potato routing: a technique that immediately routes data packets without storing them in
buffers. it continuously transfers packets until they reach the final destination. in contrast
to store-and-forward. commonly used in optical networks where messages cannot be stored in
any medium.
ISP: hands off to downstream ISP ASAP. minimize work to be done.
---
cold potato routing: opposite of hot potato. ISP: carry the traffic on its own network for
as far as possible before handing it off to downstream ISP. maximum control on the end-to-end
quality of service.

To have "skin in the game" is to have incurred risk (monetary or otherwise) by being involved in
achieving a goal. In the phrase, "skin" is a synecdoche for the person involved, and "game" is the
metaphor for actions on the field of play under discussion.

synecdoche: a figure of speech in which a part is made to represent the whole or vice versa, as in
Cleveland won by six runs (meaning “Cleveland's baseball team”).

columnar db: store data in column-major order, as opposed to row-major order.
allow a single column to be kept in a contiguous piece of memory. can sort and aggregate very fast.

HTTP:
HEAD method: get the headers only (use curl -I)
OPTIONS method: discover which HTTP methods the resource responds to

Infrastructure as code, also referred to as IaC, refers to the process of
automatically manage and provision the technology stack for an application through
software, rather than using a manual process to configure discrete hardware devices and operating
systems. Infrastructure as code is sometimes referred to as programmable or software-defined
infrastructure.
---
Infrastructure as code uses higher-level or descriptive language to code more versatile and adaptive
provisioning and deployment processes. For example, infrastructure-as-code capabilities included
with Ansible, an IT management and configuration tool, can install MySQL server, verify that MySQL
is running properly, create a user account and password, set up a new database, and remove unneeded
databases.
---
Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a method to provision and manage IT infrastructure through the use
of software, rather than through standard operating procedures and manual processes.
---
Configuration orchestration tools, which include Terraform and AWS CloudFormation, are designed to
automate the deployment of servers and other infrastructure.
--
Configuration management tools like Chef, Puppet, help configure the software and systems on this
infrastructure that has already been provisioned.

You have to take the good with the bad, smile with the sad. love what you got, and remember what you
had. Always forgive, but never forget, learn from your mistakes but never regret. People change,
things go wrong, but just remember life goes on.

== BaaS ==
backend as a service providers: CloudBoost, Firebase, Azure, Oracle Cloud, Parse, Red Hat

Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) is a cloud service model in which developers outsource all the
behind-the-scenes aspects of a web or mobile application so that they only have to write and
maintain the frontend. BaaS vendors provide pre-written software for activities that take place on
servers, such as user authentication, database management, remote updating, and push notifications
(for mobile apps), as well as cloud storage and hosting.

BaaS features: user login and authentication, data persistence, cloud storage, msg and
custom business logic, push notifications, remote updating, hosting.

BaaS vs serverless
The backends of serverless applications are broken up into functions, each of which responds to
events and performs one action only. BaaS server-side functionalities, meanwhile, are constructed
however the provider wants, and developers don't have to concern themselves with coding anything
other than the frontend of the application.
===
Serverless architectures are event-driven, meaning they run in response to events. Each function
only runs when it is triggered by a certain event, and it does not run otherwise. Applications built
with BaaS are usually not event-driven, meaning that they require more server resources.
===
Scalability is one of the biggest differentiators separating serverless architectures from other
kinds of architecture. In serverless computing, the application automatically scales up as usage
increases. The cloud vendor's infrastructure starts up ephemeral instances of each function as
necessary. BaaS applications are not set up to scale in this way unless the BaaS provider also
offers serverless computing and the developer builds this into their application.

Function as a service (FaaS) is a serverless way to execute modular pieces of code on the edge. FaaS
lets developers write and update a piece of code on the fly, which can then be executed in response
to an event, such as a user clicking on an element in a web application. This makes it easy to scale
code and is a cost-efficient way to implement microservices.

Edge computing means bringing computing closer to the source of the data, such as on a user's
computer, an IoT device, or an edge server (instead of in the cloud). This minimizes the need for
long distance communications between client and server, which reduces latency and bandwidth usage.

A CDN edge server is a computer that exists at the logical extreme or edge of a network. An edge
server often serves as the connection between separate networks. A primary purpose of a CDN edge
server is to store content as close as possible to a requesting client machine, thereby reducing
latency and improving page load times.

An edge server is a type of edge device that provides an entry point into a network. Other edges
devices include routers and routing switches. Edge devices are often placed inside Internet exchange
points (IxPs) to allow different networks to connect and share transit.

If a network wants to connect to another network or the larger Internet, it must have some form of
bridge in order for traffic to flow from one location to another. Hardware devices that creates
this bridge on the edge of a network are called edge devices.

An Internet exchange point (IXP) is a physical location through which Internet infrastructure
companies such as Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and CDNs connect with each other. These
locations exist on the “edge” of different networks, and allow network providers to share transit
outside their own network. By having a presence inside of an IXP location, companies are able to
shorten their path to the transit coming from other participating networks, thereby reducing
latency, improving round-trip time, and potentially reducing costs.

CDN will place servers at the exchange points between different networks.

protocol buffers: a data interchange format for faster network transfer and serialization.
protocol buffers: a language-neutral way of serializing structured data.

Packet filtering is a firewall technique used to control network access by monitoring outgoing and
incoming packets and allowing them to pass or halt based on the source and destination Internet
Protocol (IP) addresses, protocols and ports.

blockchain: an immutable ledger for recording transactions, maintained within a distributed network
of mutually untrusting peers. every peer maintains a copy of the ledger. the peers execute a
consensus protocol to validate transactions, group them into blocks, and build a hash chain over the
blocks. public/permissionless blockchain: anyone can participate. permissioned: known participants.

runbook: a compilation of procedures and operations that the operator carries out.

A storage engine is a software module that a database management system uses to create, read, update
data from a database.

ISAM (an acronym for indexed sequential access method) is a method for creating, maintaining, and
manipulating indexes of key-fields extracted from random data file records to achieve fast retrieval
of required file records.

Staff and line are names given to different types of functions in organizations. A "line function"
is one that directly advances an organization in its core work. This always includes production and
sales, and sometimes also marketing. A "staff function" supports the organization with specialized
advisory and support functions. For example, human resources, accounting, public relations and the
legal department are generally considered to be staff functions. Both terms originated in the
military.

A nostro account refers to an account that a bank holds in a foreign currency in another
bank. Nostros are frequently used to facilitate foreign exchange and trade transactions.  The
opposite term "vostro accounts", is how a bank refers to the accounts that other banks have on its
books in its home currency.
===
A nostro account and a vostro account actually refer to the same entity but from a different
perspective. For example, Bank X has an account with Bank Y in Bank Y's home currency. To Bank X,
that is a nostro, meaning "our account on your books," while to Bank Y, it is a vostro, meaning
"your account on our books." These accounts are used to facilitate international transactions and to
settle transactions that hedge exchange rate risk.

runtime: the specific implementation of a language that supports its execution. An example might be
the Java HotSpot runtime. A container runtime is responsible for all the parts of running a
container that isn't actually running the program itself.
container runtime example: runc, lxc, lmctfy, Docker (containerd), rkt, cri-o.

JWT is a token format. OAuth is an authorization protocol that can use JWT as a token.

parallel execution model: fork/join vs mapreduce
===
fork/join: single node, multicore parallelism. partition a task into several subtasks, in a
recursive-looking fashion. allows workers to steal subtasks from each others' queues.
===
mapreduce: computer cluster, distributed parallelism.  does one big split, with the mapped splits
not talking between each other at all, and then reduces everything together.

ineffable: incapable of being expressed or described in words

yak shaving: all that stuff that you need to do to solve some problem.
refers to a task, that leads you to perform another related task and so on, and so on — all
distracting you from your original goal.
--
1. Any apparently useless activity which, by allowing you to overcome intermediate difficulties,
allows you to solve a larger problem.
e.g. I was doing a bit of yak shaving this morning, and it looks
like it might have paid off.
--
2. A less useful activity done consciously or subconsciously to
procrastinate about a larger but more useful task.
e.g. I looked at a reference manual for my car just
to answer one question, but I spent the whole afternoon with my nose buried in it, just yak shaving,
and got no work done on the car itself.

Capacity: The number of transactions that can be processed on the network.
Scalability: ability of the network to handle a growing amount of work.

Capacity Testing measures how many users the application can handle. It is a subset of scalability
testing, in that when testing scalability, you will get a measure of application capacity.
==
Scalability Testing measures how well the application handles increasing numbers of users. If you
test scalability until the application fails, you will have a measure of how many users (capacity)
the application can handle.

route: mapping from URL to a handler

authentication: the process of verifying the identity of a user
authorization: the process of verifying what the user is allowed to do.

synecdoche: a figure of speech

An income share agreement (or ISA) is a financial structure in which an individual or organization
provides something of value (often a fixed amount of money) to a recipient who, in exchange, agrees
to pay back a percentage of their income for a fixed number of years.

JOSE (JavaScript Object Signing and Encryption) is a framework intended to provide a method to
securely transfer claims (such as authorization information) between parties. The JOSE framework
provides a collection of specifications to serve this purpose. A JSON Web Token (JWT) contains
claims that can be used to allow a system to apply access control to resources it owns. One
potential use case of the JWT is as the means of authentication and authorization for a system that
exposes resources through an OAuth 2.0 model.

data mart: a subset of data warehouse and is usually oriented to a specific business line or team.

separating compute and storage: designing database systems such that all persistent data is stored
on remote, network attached storage.  In this architecture, local storage is only used for transient
data, which can always be rebuilt (if necessary) from the data on persistent storage

Semi-structured data is a form of structured data that does not obey the formal structure of data
models associated with relational databases or other forms of data tables, but nonetheless contains
tags or other markers to separate semantic elements and enforce hierarchies of records and fields
within the data. example: json, xml, csv, tab-delimited files

Converged infrastructure:
an approach to data center management that packages compute, networking, servers, storage and
virtualization tools on a prequalified turnkey appliance. known as infrastructure in a box.

Hyper-converged infrastructure (HCI) is a software-defined IT infrastructure that virtualizes all of
the elements of conventional "hardware-defined" systems. HCI includes, at a minimum, virtualized
computing (a hypervisor), a virtual SAN (VSAN) (software-defined storage) and virtualized networking
(software-defined networking). HCI typically runs on commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) servers.  The
primary difference between converged infrastructure (CI) and hyper-converged infrastructure is that
in HCI, both the storage area network and the underlying storage abstractions are implemented
virtually in software (at or via the hypervisor) rather than physically, in hardware. Because all of
the software-defined elements are implemented within the context of the hypervisor, management of
all resources can be federated (shared) across all instances of a hyper-converged infrastructure.
