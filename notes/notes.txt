scourge, bane, : something causing misery
(the bane of my life)

cynosure: An object that serves as a focal point of attention and admiration.
Something that serves to guide.

spectral line: atoms absorb and give out light at characteristic wavelengths.
if they swallow more than they emit, the result is a dark line in the spectrum
of a celestial object. if they emit more than they swallow, the result is
a bright line.
Individual elements have their own spectrum. When hydrogen gas is heated,
it gives off only a few narrow colored lines that make up the unique spectral
fingerprint of that element. This is called emission spectrum. If light from
a star passes through a cool cloud of the same gas, the element will absorb
from the light the same colored bands produced by an emission spectrum, leaving
black lines in their place. The result is an absorption spectrum.
absorpton lines are produced when particular wavelenghts of radiation from a
hot source are absorbed by a cooler, intervening medium.

Because the moon completes each rotation in exactly the same time it takes
to revolve the Earth, we can only look at one side of the moon.
+++
the Moon is in a synchronous orbit (meaning it spins exactly once on its axis for
 every one revolution around Earth), forced to show the same face toward Earth for all eternity.

supernova: a cataclysmic explosion of a massive star. an explosion where
a dying star blows off its outer layers.

Right ascension: celestial equivalent of terrestrial longitude.

black body: a body that absorbs all the heat that falls on it.

In computer networking literature, digital bandwidth refers to data rate
measured in bit/s, for example channel capacity (digital bandwidth capacity)
or throughput (digital bandwidth consumption). The reason for this usage
is that the channel capacity in bit/s is proportional to the analogue bandwidth
in hertz according to Hartley's law.

In communication networks, throughput is the amount of digital data per
time unit that is delivered over a physical or logical link, or that is
passing through a certain network node. For example, it may be the amount
 of data that is delivered to a certain network terminal or host computer,
 or between two specific computers. The throughput is usually measured
in bits per second (bits/s or bps), occasionally in data packets per
 second or data packets per timeslot. The term corresponds to digital bandwidth consumption.

Cable modems are primarily used to deliver broadband Internet access,
taking advantage of unused bandwidth on a cable television network.
Like all residential broadband network technologies (e.g. DSL, FTTX,
 Satellite internet, WiMAX), a fixed channel capacity is shared by a
 population of users (in the case of cable internet, users in a neighborhood
share the available capacity provided by a single coaxial cable line).
 Therefore, service speed can vary depending on how many people are using the service at the same time.

octothorpe: the # sign

point-and-shoot vs SLR:
The image that the photographer sees through the viewfinder of a point-and-shoot
camera is not the same image that passes through the primary lens of the camera
 (that is, the lens that projects the image onto the film or,
in the case of digital cameras, the image sensor). Rather, the
image seen in the viewfinder of a point-and-shoot camera passes
 through a separate lens. SLRs, on the other hand, have only one lens,
and a mirror diverts the image from the lens into the viewfinder;
 that mirror then retracts when the picture is taken so that
 the image can be recorded on the film or sensor. It is because
of this method of diverting the image into the viewfinder that
 pictures cannot be previewed on the LCD screens of most digital SLRs.

fluorescence: Fluorescence is a luminescence that is mostly found as an
optical phenomenon in cold bodies, in which the molecular absorption of
a photon triggers the emission of another photon with a longer wavelength.
The energy difference between the absorbed and emitted photons ends up as
 molecular vibrations or heat. Usually the absorbed photon is in the
 ultraviolet range, and the emitted light is in the visible range,

The life of a CFL lamp is significantly shorter if it is only turned on for
 a few minutes at a time: In the case of a 5-minute on/off cycle the lifespan
of a CFL can be up to 85% shorter, reducing its lifespan to the level of an incandescent lamp

Zoning is a term used in urban planning for a system of land-use regulation in various parts of the world.
The word is derived from the practice of designating permitted uses of land based on mapped
zones which separate one set of land uses from another.
Theoretically, the primary purpose of zoning is to segregate uses that are thought
 to be incompatible; in practice, zoning is used as a permitting system to prevent
new development from harming existing residents or businesses.
A term that refers to a system of land-use  regulation that specifies
what can be built on a piece of land.

dentistry:
 The letter part of the code refers to different parts or surfaces of the tooth.
An "M" mesial, or "D" distal, is the front or back surface of the tooth, respectively.
An "O" occlusal, is the top or biting surface of a back tooth (molar or premolar),
and "I" incisal, is the biting edge of front teeth (incisors and canines).
 A "B" buccal, is the surface of the tooth towards the cheek, and an "L" lingual,
 is the surface of the tooth towards the tongue. So if the dentist says number
3MOD, you'll know that you have a cavity on your upper right first molar,
 involving the front, top, and back parts of the tooth.
occlusal: biting surface
mesial: toward the center of the mouth
distal: away from the center of the mouth
facial: toward the face
buccal: toward the cheek
lingual: toward the tongue

silver amalgam: biocompatible (unlikely to iritate living tissue. not actually
cemented to the cavity walls. it is held in place by a close frictional
fit, plus undercutting the cavity  to lock in the in the filling when it hardens.
require at least 24 hours before reaching full strength (do not chew on it for
at least 24 hours). require support from the surrounding tooth to keep it from
chipping or shattering.

composite resin: not as strong as amalgam. not biocompatible, must be separated
from living tissue with bases or liners. easily stained. boundaries between
the tooth and the filling tend to open up.

Dental sealants (also known as "tooth sealants") can play an important role
in helping to prevent tooth decay ("cavities") in some locations on teeth.
 The placement of dental sealants involves your dentist bonding a plastic
 coating into the grooves of your tooth (the tooth's pits and fissures).
 The net result is a smoother tooth surface, one which is less likely to
trap food and plaque and one which is easier to clean with your toothbrush.

PPO: offer a list of dentists/doctors who have agreed to provide services
at a discounted fee.

HMO: dentist/doctor agrees to provide care in exchange for an amount prepaid
by the insurer per consumer per month. (capitation fee)

Blue Cross and Blue Shield consists of a network of local community health service corporations.
A nationwide federation, Blue Cross and Blue Shield operate under and
are covered by state laws as not-for-profit service providers.
Blue Cross covers hospital costs, as well as outpatient care and home care.
Blue Shield plans cover physicians' services, dental, vision, and some
outpatient services. The two plans cooperate with one another
 to provide a form of comprehensive coverage for the subscribers to the plans.

Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) provides prepaid comprehensive health care
 services to an enrolled group of members within a specified area -- controlled
by geography and enrollment allowances. Its doctors are employed by the HMO, on
a salary which is not dictated by the number or patients or the nature of the
 treatment given. The HMO selects its doctors, hospitals and other care facilities,
 which are solely offered under its coverage. An HMO may be contracted by both
for-profit and nonprofit health organizations to provide care.
The enrollee is required to choose a primary care provider, and agree to only see them for medical care.
There is no deductible or coinsurance for health care, and little red tape if you go in for care services.
A benefit of HMOs is the coverage for preventative health care, including
checkups and many testing procedures. In fact, emphasis is placed on preventative medicine
Most HMO coverage is employer-provided, and is group coverage. That
is, a group of people are enrolled at a group rate,
Freedom of choice exists only within the infrastructure of selected doctors
and facilities. To be fully covered by the HMO, the insured has to use
the HMO's previously arranged services.

Staff Model HMOs: is a network of salaried employees of the HMO,
consisting of doctors, physicians and specialists who are employed
s by the HMO, and the facility is often owned by the HMO.
However, most have contracts with other hospitals and physicians to provide
 care to HMO clients at other facilities. Internal medicine physicians,
 family physicians, and pediatricians are chosen from the hospital-based HMO staff

Group Model HMO: A physicians group is contracted by the HMO to provide
its specific services to the enrollees. Rarely are the physicians directly
employed, nor are the HMO participants their only patients.

Independent Practice Associations (IPAs): Individual private practitioners are contracted,
and they are paid a fixed fee per each patient they agree to treat under HMO contract.
They are chosen by the HMO members as the primary care doctors. IPAs offer more choice
 to HMO recipients, since there are a lot of private practice doctors to choose from,
once the HMO contract has been prepared with the physicians. It is also sometimes
 possible to avoid changing your doctor when you change to an IPA-HMO, if a
contract can be established between the HMO and your current doctor(s).

Point Of Service Plans (POS):
 Traditionally, HMOs have kept their costs to a minimum by managing care. To manage
care, HMOs keep medical care and expenses in their network of doctors and facilities.
HMOs commonly frown on its members seeking care outside the network, and maintain
this system by requiring members to pay high out-of-pocket (sometimes footing the
entire bill) costs when care is provided by physicians who are not employed or contracted by the HMO.
The POS was developed to provide HMO members with more choices. Still restricted
 somewhat (not offered by all HMOs or employers., POs plans offer coverage outside
the network of the HMO, but the coverage outside the network resembles traditional
 health care insurance, where it is required to pay a deductible for that care
outside the HMO structure. This coverage is most often chosen by a family that
wishes to see a family physician they have dealt with for years, but who is not
 a part of their HMO system.

Preferred Provider Organization (PPO): A PPO is usually put together by an
insurance company or employer, in that they arrange a network of doctors and
 hospitals to provide care at a lower cost than traditional insurance.
PPOs have higher premiums, and also require the payment of a deductible for health services.
 The system works as though one were simply getting a percentage discount on
medical care. In this manner, it is a fee-for-service policy, rather than
prepaid for services. For coverage outside the network, the insurer pays
less of the bill and the insured has more out-of-pocket expenses. In some
ways the PPO is a lot more lenient. For example, it is not necessary to
choose a primary care physician and only receive care from that provider.

medicare:
   1.   Those 65 or older who are also eligible for Social Security benefits based on their acquired credits and years in the work force.
   2. Those disabled and under the age of 65 -- but they have to meet requirements of Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) through the Disability Determination Service (DDS. of the particular state government.
   3. People any age who have permanent kidney failure.
   4. Those 65 or older who are beneficiaries of Railroad Retirement.
Medicare:
Part A covers costs while hospitalized, and services procured in the
hospital. Inpatient services which are deemed medically necessary are
 covered, as well as hospice care for the terminally ill. Home health
care is fully covered, as well as 80 percent of necessary medical
equipment. If the patient must pay for blood on a regular basis,
Medicare Part A will pick up the payments after the insured pays
for the first three pints (three pints a year). The premium of
part A coverage is covered by FICA taxes as long as one is approved for Social Security.
Part B coverage helps pay for physician services, other medical procedures, and supplies including tests, prescription drugs, speech therapy and other services. Medicare Part B requires that the recipient pay a premium for this coverage.

Medicare Supplement Policies (Medigap):
are not government policies as are Medicare and Medicaid, although Medigap
 may be regulated strictly by some states. In most states, Medigap is offered

coverage is offered by private insurers,

Medicaid: Run by the states, unlike the federally funded Medicare program,
Medicaid provides health coverage for low-income families and individuals who have few assets.

Strategic thinking, planning, and actions reflect the doer's ability to consider
 the big picture, recognize patterns and trends, honor priorities, anticipate
issues, predict outcomes, and have smart alternatives to fall back upon. Strategic
issues deal with overriding mission and purpose, why the organization exists,
how it makes a difference that others don't or can't make, and where it will be in the future.

Tactical refers to the hands-on part of getting the job done, making sure the
strategic goals are met. It's performing each implementation task with quality and efficiency.

The Prudent Man Rule is based on common law stemming from the 1830 Massachusetts
 court decision - Harvard College v. Armory, 9 Pick. (26 Mass.) 446, 461 (1830).
The Prudent Man Rule directs trustees "to observe how men of prudence, discretion
 and intelligence manage their own affairs, not in regard to speculation, but in
regard to the permanent disposition of their funds, considering the probable
income, as well as the probable safety of the capital to be invested"
The fiduciary is required to invest trust assets as a "prudent man" would invest
his own property with the following factors in mind: the needs of beneficiaries,
 the need to preserve the estate (or corpus of the trust) and the amount and
regularity of income. The application of these general principles depends on
the type of account administered. The Prudent Man Rule continues to be the
sprevailing statute in a small number of states.

An application server is a software engine that delivers applications to client computers
 or devices, typically through the Internet and using the HyperText Transfer Protocol.
 Application servers are distinguished from web servers by the extensive use of
server-side dynamic content and frequent integration with database engines.

An application server handles most, if not all, of the business logic and data
access of the application (see Centralization). The main benefit of an application
server is the ease of application development, since applications need not be programmed;
 instead, they are assembled from building blocks provided by the application server.

   1. Prof. Jones: "The university just cut our yearly budget by $10,000."
      Prof. Smith: "What are we going to do?"
      Prof. Brown: "I think we should eliminate one of the teaching assistant positions.
		That would take care of it."
      Prof. Jones: "We could reduce our scheduled raises instead."
      Prof. Brown: " I can't understand why you want to bleed us dry like that, Jones."

   2. "Senator Jones says that we should not fund the attack submarine program. I disagree entirely.
	I can't understand why he wants to leave us defenseless like that."

   3. Bill and Jill are arguing about cleaning out their closets:
      Jill: "We should clean out the closets. They are getting a bit messy."
      Bill: "Why, we just went through those closets last year. Do we have to clean them out everyday?"
      Jill: "I never said anything about cleaning them out every day. You just want to keep all your
	junk forever, which is just ridiculous."

relay
A relay is a device that allows a small amount of electrical current to control a large amount of current.

Cluster vs. Grid
++
A cluster is a group of computers organized together to perform the same set of functions.
For instance, you may have a cluster running your database software.
++
A grid is a collection of resources. A grid can be composed of multiple clusters.
In Oracle's grid world, you can have a cluster of servers running the database software and a cluster of servers running the Application Server software. Since they are all in the grid, you can move resources from one cluster to another should demands dictate.
+++
In sum, a cluster is one large computer made up of small, similar computers, just
 as R.A.I.D. is one large hard disk made up of small hard disks. Whereas a grid is a bunch of computers that make their unused resources available to select computers (often a single server) over a network.
++
In cluster computing, a bunch of similar (or identical) computers are hooked up locally
(in the same physical location, directly connected with very high speed connections) to operate as
a single computer. The computers that make up the cluster cannot be operated independently
as separate computers. A cluster, as far as any software or other computer is concerned, looks
like essentially one big computer.
++
in grid computing, the computers do not have to be in the same physical location and can be operated
independently. As far as other computers are concerned each computer on the grid is a distinct computer.
Computers on a network have a program on them that allows unused resources (usually processing time and memory)
 to be used by another computer on the network.

middleware: is computer software that connects software components or applications.

An application server, in an n-tier architecture, is a server that hosts an API to expose
business logic and business processes for use by third-party applications.

Business rule is a statement that defines or constrains some aspect of the business. It is
intended to assert business structure or to control or influence the behavior of the business.

business logic:
models real life business objects (such as accounts, loans, itineraries, and inventories)
Business logic comprises:

* business rules that express business policy (such as channels, location, logistics, prices, and products); and
* workflows that are the ordered tasks of passing documents or data from one participant
  (a person or a software system) to anothother

availability: the percentage of time that a system operates during its intended duty cycle.
High availability: specifies an amount of time as a percentage of the intended duty
cycle that a system must be functional.
+++
High availability vs. fault tolerance
The difference between fault tolerance and high availability, is this: A fault tolerant
 environment has no service interruption but a significantly higher cost, while a highly
 available environment has a minimal service interruption.
+++
Fault tolerance relies on specialized hardware to detect a hardware fault and instantaneously
switch to a redundant hardware component whether the failed component is a processor, memory board,
 power supply, I/O subsystem, or storage subsystem. Although this cutover is apparently
seamless and offers non-stop service, a high premium is paid in both hardware cost and
performance because the redundant components do no processing. More importantly, the fault
tolerant model does not address software failures, by far the most common reason for downtime.
++++++
High availability views availability not as a series of replicated physical components, but
rather as a set of system-wide, shared resources that cooperate to guarantee essential
services. High availability combines software with industry-standard hardware to minimize
 downtime by quickly restoring essential services when a system, component, or application
fails. While not instantaneous, services are restored rapidly, often in less than a minute.

In all fairness,

astringent
is a chemical that tends to shrink or constrict body tissues, usually locally after topical
medicinal application.
++++
Astringency is also the dry, puckering mouthfeel caused by tannins found in many fruits such as
blackthorn, chokecherry, bird cherry and persimmon fruits, and banana skins. The tannins denature
 the salivary proteins, causing a rough "sandpapery" sensation in the mouth.
+++
Astringent substances are also found in some red wines and teas.
+++
Astringent medicines cause shrinkage of mucous membranes or exposed tissues and are often used
internally to check discharge of blood serum or mucous secretions. This can happen with a sore
throat, hemorrhages, diarrhea, or with peptic ulcers. Externally applied astringents, which
cause mild coagulation of skin proteins, dry, harden, and protect the skin.

Impromptu speaking

Impromptu Response Structures

* The first one is called PREP: Position, reason, example, position (PREP). In this model,
first you state your position on the topic, and then you state your reason for taking that position.
 Next, you provide an example or story that supports your reason. Finally, you summarize by restating
your position.
* The second structure is called PEP: Point, Example, Point (PEP). It's easier than the first one
and can be used to answer a wider variety of questions. In this one you start by briefly making
a point or stating a key idea or objective. Then you give an example or story that proves your point.
Then you wrap up by restating the main idea, or your main point. When you are short on time, this is
the way to go.
*** PEP: Point, evidence, point:
Obesity is a serious problem in the United States (Point).
Obesity is associated with over 100,000 deaths per year (Evidence).
The National Institutes of Health reported that about two-thirds of U.S. adults are obese (Point).
**** PEP: point, example, point:
I like to relax and enjoy warm, sunny, tropical beaches for my vacations.
For example, I'll be heading to an all-inclusive resort in Panama this year.
We'll be able to scuba dive, swim, kayak and just chill on the beach and my mother-in-law,
 who happens to live only 25 minutes from the resort, will takes care of my girls.
++++++++++++
* The final structure calls for you to quickly think of a way to divide up your response. I call
 this one divide and conquer. There are a few classic two and three part divisions that you'll want
to memorize such as: past, present, future; problem, solution; cost, benefit; us, them;
ideal, real; low, medium, high. Of course, there are many of these, so try to practice the
 ones that are common to your field. These are easy, you just pick an appropriate division
and then include a little bit for each section.

hashing
Hashing is the transformation of a string of characters into a usually shorter fixed-length value
or key that represents the original string. Hashing is used to index and retrieve items in a
 database because it is faster to find the item using the shorter hashed key than to find it
 using the original value. It is also used in many encryption algorithms.
+++
A hash function is any well-defined procedure or mathematical function which converts a large,
possibly variable-sized amount of data into a small datum, usually a single integer that may
serve as an index into an array. The values returned by a hash function are called hash values,
hash codes, hash sums, or simply hashes.

transitive closure:
in computer science the concept of transitive closure can be thought of as constructing
a data structure that makes it possible to answer reachability questions [1]. That is,
can one get from node a to node d in one or more hops? A binary relation tells you only
 that node a is connected to node b, and that node b is connected to node c, etc. After
the transitive closure is constructed, as depicted in the following figure, in an O(1)
operation one may determine that node d is reachable from node a. The data structure is
typically stored as a matrix, so if matrix[1][4] = 1, then it is the case that node 1
can reach node 4 through one or more hops.
+++
Transitive closure can be thought of as establishing a data structure that makes
it possible to solve reachability questions (can I get to x from y?) efficiently.
After the preprocessing of constructing the transitive closure, all reachability
queries can be answered in constant time by simply reporting a matrix entry. Transitive
closure is fundamental in propagating the consequences of modified attributes of a graph G.
 For example, consider the graph underlying any spreadsheet model, where the vertices are
cells and there is an edge from cell $i$ to cell j if the result of cell j depends on
cell i. When the value of a given cell is modified, the values of all reachable cells
must also be updated. The identity of these cells is revealed by the transitive closure
of G. Many database problems reduce to computing transitive closures, for analogous reasons.
+++
related to directed graph
+++
Several graph-based algorithms have been proposed in the literature to compute
the transitive closure of a directed graph
+++
transitive closure is a data structure for answering reachability questions:
can I get from point A to point B? usually in the form of a matrix,
e.g., matrix[1][4]=1 means I can go from point 1 to point 4.

fault-tolerance
replication:
Providing multiple identical instances of the same system or subsystem, directing tasks
or requests to all of them in parallel, and choosing the correct result on the basis of a quorum;
++++
redundancy: Providing multiple identical instances of the same system and switching to one
of the remaining instances in case of a failure (failover);

storage area network (SAN)
is an architecture to attach remote computer storage devices (such as disk arrays, tape libraries,
and optical jukeboxes) to servers in such a way that the devices appear as locally attached to
the operating system.
++++
Network-attached storage (NAS)
vs SAN: uses file-based protocols such as NFS or SMB/CIFS where it is clear that the storage is remote,
and computers request a portion of an abstract file rather than a disk block.
is file-level computer data storage connected to a computer network providing data access to
heterogeneous network clients.
++++
difference
A NAS is a single storage device that operate on data files, while a SAN is a local
 network of multiple devices that operate on disk blocks.
+++
difference
SAN: uses Fibre Channel interconnects (wire), encapsulated SCSI (protocol)
NAS: uses Ethernet and TCP/IP

Java generics
allow "a type or method to operate on objects of various types while providing compile-time type safety
++++
allows the programmer to specify the type that will be accepted by an object.
classic example: collection framework
by default, a collection can accept any object.
generics allows the programmer to create a collection that accepts only
a certain of objects. This allows the compiler to check the type correctness
of the program at compile-time.
+++
allow programmer to specify concrete types to general purpose classes and methods
that operated on Object.
allow you to limit what kind of objects can be inserted into the collection.
+++
Generic programming is a style of computer programming in which algorithms are written
in terms of to-be-specified-later types that are then instantiated when needed for specific
types provided as parameters.
====
allow you to write code that operates on objects whose types have not been determined.
=====
called generics in Java and C#, template in C++, parameterized type by gang of four.
+++
type erasure:
When a generic type is instantiated, the compiler translates those types by a technique called
type erasure  a process where the compiler removes all information related to type parameters
 and type arguments within a class or method. Type erasure enables Java applications that use
generics to maintain binary compatibility with Java libraries and applications that were
 created before generics.
e.g. ArrayList<String> is translated to ArrayList, which is called the raw type.
raw type: a generic class without any type arguments.
++++
A class is generic if it declares one or more type variables. These type variables are known
as the type parameters of the class.

canonical:
Authoritative or standard; conforming to an accepted rule or procedure.
When referring to programming, canonical means conforming to well-established patterns or rules.
When referring to IP addressing, canonical means the authoritative host name stored
in a DNS database that all of an IP address aliases resolve to.
+++

canonicalization
in computer science, canonicalization (abbreviated c14n, where 14 represents the number of letters
between the C and the N) is a process for converting data that has more than one possible
representation into a "standard" canonical representation.

bookmarklet
A bookmarklet is an applet, a small computer application, stored as the URL of a bookmark
 in a web browser or as a hyperlink on a web page. The term is a portmanteau of
the terms bookmark and applet. Whether bookmarklet utilities are stored as bookmarks
or hyperlinks, they are designed to add one-click functionality to a browser or web
 page. When clicked, a bookmarklet performs some function, one of a wide variety
such as a search query or data extraction. Usually the applet is a JavaScript program.

Objects In Mirror Are Closer Than They Appear
passenger-side side-view mirror
passenger-side mirrors are convex to allow the drivers to get a wide-angle view of the road
-- behind them and to the sides -- but at the same time, causes objects to appear more distant.
A flat mirror used on driver's side mirrors, on the other hand, would not provide a wider view
of the road.

ODBC
a standard that enables applications to interact with different db. a wrapper around
databases that makes all db behave in a consistent and clearly defined fashion.
It accomplishes this by using s/w drivers that two primary functions. First, they
encapsulate any native db features and hide these from the client. Second, they provide
a common language for interacting with the db.
ODBC client applications do not interact with db directly. Instead, they interact with
ODBC data sources. a data source is logical db that includes the driver (each db type
has its own driver) and info on how to connect to the db.

Wiki is a piece of server software that allows users to freely create and edit
 Web page content using any Web browser. Wiki supports hyperlinks and has a simple
text syntax for creating new pages and crosslinks between internal pages on the fly.
Wiki is unusual among group communication mechanisms in that it allows the
 organization of contributions to be edited in addition to the content itself.

copy-on-write
an optimizing strategy in computer programming. here's how it works.
let's say multiple processes want to access a resource. instead of giving
each process a copy of the resource, you give them a pointer to the same resource.
when one of the processes tries to modify the resource, you create a private copy
for that process. this prevents the changes from becoming visible to everyone else.

shadow paging
a copy-on-write technique for avoiding in-place updates of pages. when a page is to
be modified, a shadow page is allocated. The shadow page is then modified (the
original page is unchanged). when the shadow page is ready to become persistent,
all pages that refer to the original are updated to refer to the new replacement page.

hypervisor,
also called virtual machine monitor (VMM), is a piece of software/hardware platform-virtualization
software that allows multiple operating systems to run on a host computer concurrently.
+++
Type 1 (or native, bare-metal) hypervisors are software systems that run directly on the
host's hardware to control the hardware and to monitor guest operating-systems.
A guest operating system thus runs on another level above the hypervisor.
examples include VMware ESX Server, Microsoft Hyper-V
+++
Type 2 (or hosted) hypervisors are software applications running within a conventional
operating-system environment. Considering the hypervisor layer as a distinct software
layer, guest operating systems thus run at the third level above the hardware.
Examples include VMware Server (formerly known as GSX), VMware Workstation,
 VMware Fusion, the open source QEMU, Microsoft Virtual PC and Microsoft Virtual Server products,

========= cloud computing ==========
cloud computing
The cloud is a metaphor for "the Internet."
cloud computing means using the Internet to provide your programs and store your data.
+++
a general term for anything that involves delivering hosted services over the Internet.
These services are broadly divided into three categories: Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS),
Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS).
+++
A cloud service has three distinct characteristics that differentiate it from traditional
hosting. It is sold on demand, typically by the minute or the hour; it is elastic -- a
user can have as much or as little of a service as they want at any given time; and
the service is fully managed by the provider (the consumer needs nothing but a personal
computer and Internet access).
+++
Infrastructure-as-a-Service like Amazon Web Services provides virtual server instances
with unique IP addresses and blocks of storage on demand. Customers use the provider's
application program interface (API) to start, stop, access and configure their virtual
servers and storage
+++
Platform-as-a-service in the cloud is defined as a set of software and product
 development tools hosted on the provider's infrastructure. Developers create
applications on the provider's platform over the Internet. PaaS providers may
use APIs, website portals or gateway software installed on the customer's computer.
 Force.com, (an outgrowth of Salesforce.com) and GoogleApps are examples of PaaS.
+++
In the software-as-a-service cloud model, the vendor supplies the hardware infrastructure,
 the software product and interacts with the user through a front-end portal. SaaS is
a very broad market. Services can be anything from Web-based email to inventory control
and database processing. Because the service provider hosts both the application and
the data, the end user is free to use the service from anywhere.

container: a run-time environment for components.

servlet: purpose is to receive HTTP requests, generate dynamic data (usually in HTML),
and delver an HTTP response.
Servlets are pure Java objects that generate HTML by writing it to a stream. The files
do not contain any HTML tags; they simply contain Java code which write out HTML (as strings)
 to produce the page that is sent to the user's browser.

JSP: an HTML page containing embedded java code. an HTML page embedded with java code.

JSPs and servlets are two different ways to accomplish the same goal: generating dynamic HTML pages
 using Java code. One puts Java code in your HTML, and one puts HTML in your Java code.
Functionally, they are equivalent. In fact, under the covers, the web server takes a JSP and
converts it to the corresponding servlet and dynamically compiles it.

JSPs live in an object called a container, which is essentially a server

computer architecture.
+++
The southbridge can usually be distinguished from the northbridge by not being directly
 connected to the CPU. Rather, the northbridge ties the southbridge to the CPU.

Design by Contract (DbC) or Programming by Contract is an approach to designing computer
software. It prescribes that software designers should define formal, precise and verifiable
interface specifications for software components, which extend the ordinary definition
of abstract data types with preconditions, postconditions and invariants.
+++
preconditions: what must be true when the method is called
postconditions: what must be true after the method completes
class invariant: what must be true about each instance of a class
+++
design by contract says that there are 3 concepts about any piece of code:
preconditions, postconditions, and invariants
+++
precondition: expect a certain condition to be true on entry
postcondition: guarantee a certain condition on exit
invariant: maintain a certain condition
--- 3 questions about the contract:
what does the contract expect?
what does the contract guarantee?
what does the contract maintain?

virtual memory
An imaginary memory area supported by some operating systems
in conjunction with the hardware. You can think of virtual memory as an alternate set of
 memory addresses. Programs use these virtual addresses rather than real addresses to store
instructions and data. When the program is actually executed, the virtual addresses are
converted into real memory addresses.
The purpose of virtual memory is to enlarge the address space, the set of addresses a program
 can utilize. For example, virtual memory might contain twice as many addresses as main memory.
 A program using all of virtual memory, therefore, would not be able to fit in main memory all
 at once. Nevertheless, the computer could execute such a program by copying into main memory
those portions of the program needed at any given point during execution.
To facilitate copying virtual memory into real memory, the operating system divides virtual
 memory into pages, each of which contains a fixed number of addresses. Each page is stored
on a disk until it is needed. When the page is needed, the operating system copies it from
disk to main memory, translating the virtual addresses into real addresses.
+++
 gives an application program the impression that it has contiguous working memory
(an address space), while in fact it may be physically fragmented and may even
 overflow on to disk storage.

thrashing
In systems that use virtual memory, the resulting condition of a hard drive being used
 excessively for virtual memory because the physical memory (i.e., RAM) is full.
(The process of moving data into and out of virtual memory also is called swapping pages.)

ecliptic

solar day
the time it takes for the earth to complete one rotation with respect to the sun (24 hr)
the length of the solar day fluctuates throughout the year.
the average length is 24 hr: mean solar day

sidereal day
the time it takes for the earth to complete one rotation with respect to the stars (23 hr 56 minutes)

equation of time
the difference between the true solar day and the mean solar day
fictitious mean sun crosses the prime meridian at noon universal time
====
equation of time
The difference in time between what your watch reads and the position of the sun
(clock time vs. sun time) is called the Equation-of-Time. If you are in the northern
 hemisphere and the sun's position is to the east of where your watch indicates it
would be, the Equation-of-Time is negative. If the sun is to the west, the Equation-of-Time is positive.

SAX
an event-based API for parsing XML docuents. it defines various events that are
triggered while an XML parser is reading an xml document.
a custom handler can listen for these events and process the document
the handler implements the relevant callback methods and responds to various events
push model. data is pushed to the application.
When you use a SAX parser you pass a handler object to the SAX parser. This handler
object has a method for every "event" you want to handle, during the traversal of the XML document.
--> a callback-based API

SAX uses a "push" model, and StAX uses a "pull" model.
The SAX push model means that it is the SAX parser that calls your handler,
The StAX pull model means that it is your "handler" class that calls the parser,

SAX: has Schema Validation  ; no subparsing; no XML writing

test fixture
A test fixture is something used to consistently test some item, device, or piece of software.
a test fixture is all the things that must be in place in order to run a test and expect a particular outcome.
frequently fixtures are created by handling setUp() and tearDown()  events of the unit testing framework. In setUp()  one would create the expected state for the test, and in tearDown()  it would clean up what had been set up.

Four phases of a test:
   1. Set up -- Setting up the test fixture.
   2. Exercise -- Interact with the system under test.
   3. Verify -- Determine whether the expected outcome has been obtained.
   4. Tear down -- Tear down the test fixture to return to the original state.

Class of service (CoS):
is a way of managing traffic in a network by grouping similar types of traffic
(for example, e-mail, streaming video, voice, large document file transfer) together
 and treating each type as a class with its own level of service priority. Unlike Quality
of Service (QoS) traffic management, Class of Service technologies do not guarantee a level
 of service in terms of bandwidth and delivery time; they offer a "best-effort." On the other
hand, CoS technology is simpler to manage and more scalable as a network grows in structure
 and traffic volume. One can think of CoS as "coarsely-grained" traffic control and QoS as
 "finely-grained" traffic control.
+++++++++++
a form of priority queuing that has been used in a number of communication and networking protocols.
It is a way of classifying and prioritizing packets based on application type
++++
CoS is a queuing discipline while QoS covers a wider range of techniques to manage bandwidth and network resources.
+++
As an analogy, CoS is like classifying packages for delivery via regular mail, second-day delivery,
or next-day delivery. QoS is what the delivery company does to ensure your packages are delivered
on time (such as package tracking, air transport, door-to-door pickup and drop-off).

coupling: the degree to which a module depends on another module.
cohesion: a measure of how strongly-related or focused the responsibilities of a single module are

Good cohesion is desired within object-oriented programming so that each class has a well defined purpose and therefore contains the variables and methods necessary to fulfill that purpose.
low coupling often correlates with high cohesion

MapReduce
from lisp:
map:
let's say we have a square function: square(x) = x*x

calling map square [1,2,3,4,5] will return [1,4,9,16,25], as map will go through the
 list, and apply the function square to each element.

reduce/fold:
folding of the list [1,2,3,4,5] with the addition operator would result in 15, the
 sum of the elements of the list [1,2,3,4,5]

In Lisp, a map takes as input a function and a sequence of values. It then applies
 the function to each value in the sequence. A reduce combines all the elements of a
sequence using a binary operation. For example, it can use "+" to add up all the elements in the sequence.

mapreduce of google:

map: takes an input pair and produces a set of intermediate key/value pairs.
reduce: accepts an intermediate key and a set of values for that key. It merges together these
 values to form a possibly smaller set of values.

e.g.
consider the problem of counting the number of occurrences of each word in a large collection of documents:

map(String key, String value):
// key: document name
// value: document contents
for each word w in value:
  EmitIntermediate(w, "1");

reduce(String key, Iterator values):
// key: a word
// values: a list of counts
int result = 0;
for each v in values:
  result += ParseInt(v);
Emit(AsString(result));

The map function emits each word plus an associated count of occurrences ("1" in this example).
 The reduce function sums together all the counts emitted for a particular word.
Here, each document is split in words, and each word is counted initially with a "1" value by the Map
 function, using the word as the result key. The framework puts together all the pairs with the same
 key and feeds them to the same call to Reduce, thus this function just needs to sum all of its
 input values to find the total appearances of that word.

JVM heap: an area of memory used for dynamic memory allocation. divided into 3 generations:
    * The young generation stores short-lived objects that are created and immediately garbage collected.
    * Objects that persist longer are moved to the old generation (also called the tenured generation).
    * The permanent generation (or permgen) is used for class definitions and associated metadata.

page cache / disk cache

materialized view
the query result is cached  as a concrete table that may be updated from the original base
 tables from time to time. This enables much more efficient access, at the cost of some data
being potentially out-of-date. It is most useful in data warehousing scenarios, where frequent
 queries of the actual base tables can be extremely expensive.
A materialized view is a database object that contains the results of a query. They are local
 copies of data located remotely, or are used to create summary tables based on aggregations
 of a table's data. Materialized views, which store data based on remote tables are also, know as snapshots.
the material view is manifested as a real table.
==> regular view:
a view is a virtual table representing the result of a database query. Whenever an ordinary view's
 table is queried or updated, the DBMS converts these into queries or updates against the underlying
 base tables

 is a notation for representing a fixed value in source code. Almost all programming languages have
 notations for atomic values such as integers, floating-point numbers, strings, and booleans;
 some also have notations for elements of enumerated types and compound values such as arrays, records, and objects.
--> something that represents a fixed value, such as string, integer, boolean, etc in source code

java synchronization
synchronization is required for reliable inter-thread communications as well as for mutual exclusion.
when multiple threads share mutable data, each thread that reads or writes the data must perform
synchronization. Otherwise, there is no guarantee that one thread's changes will be visible to another.

Code refactoring is the process of changing a computer program's source code without modifying its
 external functional behavior in order to improve some of the nonfunctional attributes of the software.

WebSocket is a technology providing for bi-directional, full-duplex communications channels, over
 a single Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) socket, designed to be implemented in web browsers
and web servers but can be utilised by any client or server application.
part of the HTML5 initiative
+++
introduced the WebSocket JavaScript interface, which defines a full-duplex single socket connection
 over which messages can be sent between client and server. The WebSocket standard attempts to
simplify much of the complexity around bi-directional web communication and connection management.
=====
WebSockets represent an alternative to Comet and Ajax.
+++
This specification defines an API that enables Web pages to use the WebSocket protocol for two-way
 communication with a remote host.
++++
provides for full duplex communication between a browser and a server

the original model of the web, in which a browser requests a complete web page at a time.
++++++
Comet is a web application model in which a long-held HTTP request allows a web server to push data to a browser, without the browser explicitly requesting it.
The use of Comet techniques predates the name Comet, and is also known by several other names,
 including Ajax Push, Reverse Ajax, Two-way-web, HTTP Streaming, and HTTP server push

Push technology, or server push, describes a style of Internet-based communication where the request
 for a given transaction is initiated by the publisher or central server.
It is contrasted with pull technology, where the request for the transmission of information is
 initiated by the receiver or client.

duck typing
the type of an object is defined by what it can do
This method of not caring about the actual type of a variable, just relying on what methods
 it supports is known as Duck Typing.

edge case
a problem or situation that occurs only at an extreme (maximum or minimum) operating parameter.

boundary case is frequently used in software engineering  to refer to the behavior of a system when
 one of its inputs is at or just beyond its maximum or minimum limits. It is frequently used when
discussing software testing.
For example, if an input field is meant to accept only integer values 0 - 100, entering the
 values -1, 0, 100, and 101 would represent the boundary cases.
=====
It is commonly thought that three cases should be used when boundary testing (one on the boundary,
 and one on either side to it). However, the case on the valid side of the boundary is redundant,
 and so equivalence partitioning recommends skipping it.

corner case (or pathological case) is a problem or situation that occurs only outside of normal
 operating parameters   specifically one that manifests itself when multiple environmental
variables or conditions are simultaneously at extreme levels, even though each parameter is
within the specified range for that parameter.
+++
Contrast a corner case with an edge case, an issue that occurs only at a (single) maximum or
 minimum parameter. For example, a speaker that distorts audio at maximum volume, even in
the absence of other extreme settings or conditions.

Behavior driven development (or BDD) is an agile software development technique that encourages
 collaboration between developers, QA and non-technical or business participants in a software project.
++
BDD focuses on obtaining a clear understanding of desired software behaviour through discussion
 with stakeholders. It extends TDD by writing test cases in a natural language that non-programmers can read.

first, you get all the persons: select name from person_table;
then for each person, you get an address: select address from address_table where person_name = ?
hence N+1
solution: use joins
select person_table.name, address_table.address
    from person_table left join address_table on (person_table.name = address_table.person_name);

Fermi paradox is the apparent contradiction between high estimates of the probability of the
 existence of extraterrestrial civilizations and the lack of evidence for, or contact with, such civilizations.

wire protocol
refers to a way of getting data from point to point: A wire protocol is needed if more than one application
has to interoperate.
the mechanism for transmitting data from point a to point b
===
In a network, it is the mechanism for transmitting data from point a to point b. It often refers
to a distributed object protocol such as SOAP, CORBA or RMI, which is software only and which
 invokes the running of programs on remote servers.
===
The term is a bit confusing, because it sounds like the physical layer (layer 1) of the network
 that places the bits "onto the wire." In some cases, it may refer to this layer; however, it
generally refers to protocols higher than the physical layer or even the next higher data link
layer (layer 2) such as Ethernet and ATM.

examples of wire protocols are
    * IIOP for CORBA
    * JRMP for RMI
    * SOAP for Web Services

In shipping, breakbulk cargo or general cargo is a term that covers a great variety of goods
 that must be loaded individually, and not in intermodal containers nor in bulk as with oil or grain.

Bulk cargo is commodity cargo that is transported unpackaged in large quantities. This cargo
is usually dropped or poured, with a spout or shovel bucket, as a liquid or as a mass of
 relatively small solids (e.g. grain, coal), into a bulk carrier ship's hold, railroad car,
or tanker truck/trailer/semi-trailer body. Smaller quantities (still considered "bulk") can
 be boxed (or drummed) and palletised. Bulk cargo is classified as liquid or dry.

POSIX
"Portable Operating System Interface for uni-X",
a set of standards for operating systems
Ideally, a developer should have to write a program only once to run on all POSIX-compliant systems.
The POSIX specifications describe an operating system that is similar to, but not necessarily the same as, Unix.

JPA: embeddable
a relationship where the target object's data is embedded in the source object's table is
considered an embedded relationship, and the target object is considered an Embeddable object.
An embeddable object cannot be directly persisted, or queried, it can only be persisted or queried in the context of its parent. An embeddable object does not have an id or table.

JPA Orphan removal will ensure that any object no longer referenced from the sourceis deleted
 from the database.

JPA cascading : allows the relationship to be cascaded
If persist() is called on the parent, and the child is also new, it will also be persisted.
used in one-to-one and one-to-many relationships
cascade options: persist, remove, merge, refresh, all

bean-managed transaction
the code in the session or message-driven bean explicitly marks the boundaries of the transaction.
 An entity bean cannot have bean-managed transactions; it must use container-managed transactions
instead. Although beans with container-managed transactions require less coding, they have one
limitation: When a method is executing, it can be associated with either a single transaction
 or no transaction at all. If this limitation will make coding your bean difficult, you should
 consider using bean-managed transactions.

Container-Managed Transactions

session: the facade through which an application accesses EclipseLink functionality
An EclipseLink session provides the primary access to the EclipseLink runtime. It is the means
 by which your application performs all persistence operations with the data source that contains
 persistent objects.

EAV
Conceptually an EAV design involves a single table with three columns, an entity (such as an
olfactory receptor ID), an attribute (such as species, which is actually a pointer into the
 metadata table) and a value for the attribute (e.g., rat). In EAV design, one row stores
 a single fact. In a conventional table that has one column per attribute, by contrast,
 one row stores a set of facts. EAV design is appropriate when the number of parameters
 that potentially apply to an entity is vastly more than those that actually apply to an individual entity.
+++
appropriate when the number of possible attributes is much greater than the number
that will actually apply to a given entity

 are not present, and behavior reuse (known as inheritance in class-based languages) is
performed via a process of cloning existing objects that serve as prototypes. This model
 can also be known as classless, prototype-oriented or instance-based programming.
 Delegation is the language feature that supports prototype-based programming.

JSONP: JSON with padding
a pattern of usage allowing a page to request data from a server in a different domain
--
same origin policy:
 a web page served from server1.example.com cannot normally connect to or communicate
 with a server other than server1.example.com.
---
An exception is the HTML <script> element. Exploiting the open policy for <script> elements,
 some pages use them to retrieve JavaScript code that operates on dynamically generated
JSON-formatted data from other origins. This usage pattern is known as JSONP. Requests
 for JSONP retrieve not JSON, but arbitrary JavaScript code. They are evaluated by
 the JavaScript interpreter, not parsed by a JSON parser.

In computer graphics, a sprite  is a two-dimensional image or animation that is integrated
into a larger scene.
===
CSS sprite:
To reduce the number of requests the browser makes to the server, some web designers combine
 numerous small images or icons into a larger image called a sprite sheet.
 CSS is used to display the parts of the composite image to display at different points
in the page. If a page has 10 1 kB images, they can be combined into one 10 kB image,
 downloaded with a single HTTP request, and then positioned with CSS. Reducing the number
 of HTTP requests can make a Web page load much faster.

concurrency: the execution of disparate tasks at roughtly the same time, each sharing a common
resource.
The result of concurrent tasks often affect the behavior of other concurrent tasks.
+++
Parallelism: refers to partitiioning a task into multiple parts, each run at the same time.
typically, parallel tasks work toward an aggregate goal. The result of one does not affect
the behavior of any other task.

in front of the retina. The end result being the inability to see distant objects.
is a condition in which visual images come to a focus in front of the retina of the eye,
resulting in the inability to see distant objects clearly

hyperopia: a vision problem where light rays entering the eye are brought to a focus
behind the retina. The end result being distant objects are seen more clearly than near objects.

astigmatism: a vision problem where light rays entering the eye are focused on two points
because the cornea is irregularly (not spherically) shaped. The end result is blurry images.
A vision problem where the eye does not focus light evenly.

presbyopia: the inability of the eye to focus on near objects as a person ages.

solar calendar: a calendar whose dates indicate the position of the earth in its orbit
around the sun. If the dates indicate season, it is called tropical solar calendar
(Gregorian calendar).
If the position of the earth is reckoned with respect to the fixed stars, it is
called sidereal solar calendar (Hindu Solar calendar).

ecliptic: the apparent path of the sun as seen from the earth.
If the sun's path is observed from the Earth's reference frame, it appears
 to move around the Earth in a path which is tilted with respect to the spin
 axis at 23.5. This path is called the ecliptic.
---> the sun's path in the sky

ecliptic plane: the plane that contains the orbit of the earth.

celestial sphere: an imaginary sphere of infinite radius concentric with
the earth. on which
all celestial bodies except the Earth are imagined to be projected.
+++
The stars can be imagined to be points of light on a sphere which rotates about the Earth.
 Projecting the Earth's poles and equator out onto this imaginary sphere provides a
 framework for celestial measurement.

The length of a day, which is measured by the time it takes Earth to rotate once on its axis.

mean solar day: the average period of rotation of the earth about its axis
with respect to the sun. defined to be 24 hours.

sidereal day: the period of rotation of the earth about its axis with
respect to the stars.

The celestial equator is a great circle on the imaginary celestial sphere,
 which is actually the plane of the terrestrial equator extended out into
the universe (i.e., it could be constructed by extrapolating the Earth's
equator until it touches the celestial sphere).
the projection of the geographical equator upon the celestial sphere.

great circle: a circle on the surface of a sphere that has
the same circumference as the sphere. a circle on the surface
of a sphere such that the plane containing the circle passes
through the center of the sphere.

the equivalent of latitude: declination
the equivalent of longitude: right ascension (measured in hours, minutes, seconds).
one hour = 15 degrees

Using the celestial sphere as a reference is called sidereal time.
Solar (tropical) time: use the sun as a reference.

tropical year: the length of time that the sun, as viewed from the earth, takes to return
to the same position along the ecliptic. The precise length of time depends on which
point of the ecliptic one chooses.
The time from one fixed point, such as a solstice or equinox,
to the next is called a tropical year (this is a generalization)

The time from one new moon to the next is called a synodic month.

19 years is called a Metonic cycle. 19 tropical years is about 235 synodic months.
Every 19 years, the phases of the moon fall on the same dates.

lunisolar calendar: a calendar whose dates indicate both the moon phase and the time of
the solar year. If the solar year is defined as a tropical year then a lunisolar
calendar will give an indication of the season.
the year coincides with the tropical year and the month coincides with the synodic month.

Chinese calendar: based on a combination of lunar and solar movements.
The lunar cycle is roughly 29.5 days.
Every few years, the lunar calendar is synchronized with the solar year
by adding an extra month.

intercalation: solar year does not have whole number of days. a calendar year must
have a whole number of days. To reconcile the two, one must vary the number of days
in a year. In gregorian calendar, the intercalary day is Feb 29. The solar year does
not have a whole number of months either, so lunisolar calendar must have a variable
number of months in a year.

A constellation is any one of the 88 areas into which the sky  or the celestial sphere  is divided.

The term zodiac denotes an annual cycle of twelve stations along the ecliptic,
the apparent path of the sun across the heavens through the constellations
that divide the ecliptic into twelve equal zones of celestial longitude.
The zodiac is the first known celestial coordinate system.
Zodiac: represents 12 constellations.

Common Era is the system of numbering years from the supposed beginning of the life of Jesus.

In chronology, an epoch is an instant chosen as the origin of a particular time scale.

morals: a core set of values that help us define what is right and what is wrong.
ethics: how we behave with regard to our moral values.
	When one acts in ways that are consistent with our moral values
	 we will characterize that as acting ethically

unsaturated fat: has double bonds.
saturated fat: no double bonds. saturated with hydrogen.
trans fat: vegetable oil treated with hydrogen. partially hydrogenated unsaturated fat.
	increase shelf life and flavor stability of foods containing trans fat.
	raises LDL and lowers HDL.
valence shell: the outermost electron shells.
free radical: has an unpaired electron in the valence shell. highly reactive.
oxidize: to lose an electron
oxidant (oxidizing agent): tends to oxidize other substances (i.e., steal electrons from other substances)
	A substance that gains electrons in a redox chemical reaction.
reduce: to gain an electron

oxidation is better defined as an increase in oxidation number, and reduction as a decrease in oxidation number.

Substances that have the ability to oxidize other substances are said to be oxidative
and are known as oxidizing agents, oxidants or oxidizers. Put another way, the oxidant
 removes electrons from another substance, and is thus reduced itself. And because
it "accepts" electrons it is also called an electron acceptor.

Substances that have the ability to reduce other substances are said to be reductive
and are known as reducing agents, reductants, or reducers. Put in another way, the
reductant transfers electrons to another substance, and is thus oxidized itself.
And because it "donates" electrons it is also called an electron donor.

antioxidant: reduce oxidative damage to cells. donate electrons to free radicals.
An antioxidant is a molecule capable of slowing or preventing the oxidation of other molecules.
Oxidation is a chemical reaction that transfers electrons from a substance to an oxidizing agent.
Oxidation reactions can produce free radicals, which start chain reactions that damage cells.
Antioxidants terminate these chain reactions by removing free radical intermediates, and
inhibit other oxidation reactions by being oxidized themselves. As a result, antioxidants
are often reducing agents such as thiols or polyphenols.

plant cells have walls. cell wall is composed of cellulose, hemicellulose and pectin.
Lignin fills the spaces in the cell wall between cellulose, hemicellulose and pectin components.
Lignin makes wood stiff and trees stand upright
Paper is made from wood, which is made up mainly of white cellulose. Wood also has a lot
of a dark substance in it called lignin, which ends up in the paper, too, along with the
cellulose. The exposure of lignin to air and sunlight is what turns paper yellow.

normal paper is made from wood (the cellulose found in trees)
paper money is made from cotton and linen fibers (known as rag paper)

rate is 2400 bits/s.
channel capacity: the amount of information that can be reliably transmitted over a channel.

parallax: An apparent change in the direction of an object, caused by a change
in observational position that provides a new line of sight.

Precession refers to a change in the direction of the axis of a rotating object.

A gyroscope is a device for measuring or maintaining orientation,
based on the principle of conservation of angular momentum. The
essence of the device is a spinning wheel on an axle. The device,
once spinning, tends to resist changes to its orientation due to
the angular momentum of the wheel. In physics this phenomenon is
also known as gyroscopic inertia or rigidity in space.

UML: a language for visualizing, specifying, constructing,
and documenting the artifacts of a software system.

a class is used to model an abstraction drawn from the vocabulary
of the problem space or the solution space.

interface: a collection of operations that specify the service
of a class or component.

instance: a concrete manifestation of an abstraction to which a set of
operations may be applied and which may have a state that stores
the effects of the operation.

stereotype: an extension of the vocabulary of the UML.

polymorphism:
In object-oriented programming, the ability of different objects to respond, each in its own way,
to the same message.
types of polymorphism:
(1) overloading, aka ad-hoc polymorphism
(2) type coercion
(3) parametric polymorphism: java generics, C++ templates, a method that can accept any type.
     used a lot in functional programming.
(4) subtype/inclusion polymorphism

An objects class defines how the object is implemented.
In contrast, an objects type only refers to its interface.
Class inheritance defines an objects implementation in terms of another objects implementation.
Type inheritance describes when an object can be used in place of another
Inheritance: a language feature that allows you to derive a new class from an existing class.
inheritance: object types are organized in a class hierarchy.

encapsulation:
The localization of knowledge within a module. Because objects encapsulate data and
implementation, the user of an object can view the object as a black box that provides services.
Programming technique that hides the implementation of an operation from its users behind
an abstract interface. This allows the implementation to be updated or changed without
 impacting the users of the interface.
--- data and behavior are package together.

default:
A particular setting or value for a variable that is assigned automatically
 by an operating system and remains in effect unless canceled or overridden by the operator.
A situation or condition that obtains in the absence of active intervention

Modeling is a central part of all the activities that
lead up to the deployment of good software. We
build models to communicate the desired structure and
behavior of our system. We build models to visualize
and control the system's architecture. We build models
to better understand the system we are building, often
exposing opportunities for simplification and reuse.
And we build models to manage risk.

a model is a simplification of reality.

principles of modeling:
1. The choice of what models to create has a profound influence
 on how a problem is attacked and how a solution is shaped.
2. Every model may be expressed at different levels of precision.
3. The best models are connected to reality.
4. No single model or view is sufficient. Every nontrivial
system is best approached through a small set of nearly
independent models with multiple viewpoints.

aims:
1. Models help us to visualize a system as it is or as we want it to be.
2. Models permit us to specify the structure or behavior of a system.
3. Models give us a template that guides us in constructing a system.
4. Models document the decisions we have made.

We build models of complex systems because we cannot comprehend such a system in its entirety.

To understand the architecture of such a system, you need
several complementary and interlocking views: a use case
 view (exposing the requirements of the system), a design
 view (capturing the vocabulary of the problem space and
the solution space), an interaction view (showing the
 interactions among the parts of the system and between
 the system and the environment), an implementation view
 (addressing the physical realization of the system), and
 a deployment view (focusing on system engineering issues).
 Each of these views may have structural, as well as
 behavioral, aspects. Together, these views represent
the blueprints of software.

model: an interpretation of reality that abstracts the aspects relevant
to solving the problem at hand and ignores extraneous details.

Systems design is the process or art of defining the hardware
 and software architecture, components, modules, interfaces,
and data for a computer system to satisfy specified requirements.

Abstraction is the process of reducing the information
content of a concept, or of an observation of an empirical
 phenomenon, typically in order to retain only information
which is relevant for a particular purpose. For example,
abstracting a leather soccer ball to a ball retains only
the information on general ball attributes and behaviour.
 Similarly, abstracting happiness to an emotional state
reduces the amount of information conveyed about the emotional state.
---
is the elimination of the irrelevant and the amplification of the essential.
---
An abstraction layer is a way of hiding the implementation details of a particular set of functionality.

----
omitting certain kinds of detail in order to emphasise others
"The ability to simplify means to eliminate the unnecessary so that the necessary may speak"

aggregation: composite aggregation vs shared aggregation
composition: the part cannot exist on its own

Systems analysis is the science dealing with analysis of
complex, large scale systems and the interactions within those systems.

A business analyst (BA) is responsible for analyzing the business
 needs of their clients and stakeholders to help identify business
problems and propose solutions. Within the systems
 development life cycle domain, the BA typically performs
a liaison function between the business side of an enterprise
and the information technology department or external service providers.

Requirements analysis encompasses all of the tasks that
go into the instigation, scoping and definition of a new or altered system.
Identify the needs or requirements of a client.

Popular architectural styles are often a product of the weaknesses of their predecessors.

OEM: are manufacturers who resell another company's product under
their own name and branding.
While an OEM is similar to a VAR (value-added reseller),
it refers specifically to the act of a company rebranding
 a product to its own name and offering its own warranty,
support and licensing of the product. The term is really
a misnomer because OEMs are not the original manufacturers;
they are the customizers.
OEM was an adjective used to describe a company that produced
 hardware to be marketed under another company's brand

VAR: typically load applications or proprietary software
onto computers and may also incorporate third-party options
to design a complete solution for a client. This "value-added"
system is often customized for a specific application, but
is sold to the VAR's customer base under the original design
 manufacturer brand; with that manufacturer's warranty,
 support, and license agreements.

holding company: Company formed for the purpose of owning or controlling other companies.

c/o: care of: Through someone, by way of someone, as in I sent the gift
 in care of your parents. This phrase indicates that something is
to be delivered to someone at someone else's address.

organic growth: A company is said to be growing organically when it is
increasing the turnover of its existing business.
Contrast this with a company that is growing by acquiring other companies.
The growth rate that a company can achieve by increasing output
and enhancing sales. This excludes any profits or growth
acquired from takeovers, acquisitions or mergers. Takeovers,
 acquisitions and mergers do not bring about profits generated
 within the company, and therefore, are not considered organic.
Organic growth represents the true growth for the core of the company.
 It is a good indicator of how well management has used its internal
 resources to expand profits. Organic growth also identifies whether
managers have used their skills to improve the business.

boilerplate: standard formulations uniformly found in certain types
of legal documents or news stories.

raised pavement marker: Stimsonite marker, botts' dot.

URL: a unique address for a file on the internet. URL is a type of URI.
URN: urn:<namespace identifier (NID)>:<namespace specific string (NSS)>
An URI locator is known as URL.

serialization: The process of converting the data in an object to XML (or byte stream)
is called serialization. The reverse of serialization, loading XML into the object,
is called deserialization.

Curb weight is the total weight of an automobile with standard equipment,
motor oil, coolant, a full tank of fuel and not loaded with either passengers or cargo.

A gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) is the maximum allowable total weight
of a road vehicle that is loaded to capacity, including the weight of the
vehicle itself plus fuel, passengers, cargo,

Dry weight: the weight of an automobile or motorcycle with standard equipment,
no motor oil, coolant or fuel and not loaded with either passengers or cargo.

Impedance matching is the practice of attempting to make the output impedance
of a source equal to the input impedance of the load to which it is ultimately
connected, usually in order to maximise the power transfer and minimise reflections from the load.

Impedance mismatch is a term in systems analysis which describes
an inadequate or excessive ability of one system to accommodate
input from another.

Object-relational impedance mismatch: refers to the difficulty in
mapping tables in the relational database to an object model.

severability: If any part of this agreement is legally declared invalid
or unenforceable, all other parts of this agreement are still valid and enforceable.

law of demeter: principle of least knowledge. a design guideline for software
development, particularly OO. "Talk to your immediate friends". a given object
should assume as little as possible about the structure and properties of other
objects.

QoS:
a networking term that specifies a guaranteed throughput level.
---
In the fields of packet-switched networks and computer networking,
the traffic engineering term Quality of Service (QoS) refers to control
 mechanisms that can provide different priority to different users or
 data flows, or guarantee a certain level of performance to a data
 flow in accordance with requests from the application program.
The term Quality of Service is sometimes used as a quality
measure with many alternative definitions.
The goal of QoS is to provide guarantees on the ability of a network to deliver predictable results.
Elements of network performance within the scope of QoS often
include availability (uptime), bandwidth (throughput), latency (delay), and error rate.
QoS involves prioritization of network traffic.
QoS: provides guaranteed timely delivery of specific application data or resources
 to a particular destination or destinations.

Bandwidth in computer networking refers to the data rate supported by a network connection or interface.
Bandwidth represents the capacity of the connection
the capacity of a communications channel.

throughput: Output or production, as of a computer program, over a period of time.
In communication networks, such as Ethernet or packet radio, throughput is the average rate of
successful message delivery over a communication channel. usually in bits per second

SOAP performance:
    * Extracting the SOAP envelope from the SOAP packet is time-expensive.
    * Parsing the contained XML information in the SOAP envelope using a XML parser is also time-expensive.
    * There is not much optimization possible with XML data.
    * SOAP encoding rules make it mandatory to include typing information in all
	the SOAP messages sent and received.
    * Encoding binary data in a form acceptable to XML results in overhead of
	additional bytes added as a result of the encoding as well as processor
	 overhead performing the encoding/decoding.

nanotechnology:

prolepsis: The anticipation and answering of an objection or argument before one's opponent has put it forward.

gregorian calendar: Years in the calendar are numbered from the traditional birth year of Jesus.
named after Pope Gregory XIII. Decreed in 1582. By that time, spring equinox was on Mar 10. Skipped
ten days in 1582. Adopted by UK in 1752 (skipped 11 days). motivated by the calculation of the date
of Easter (the first sunday after the first full moon on or after the spring equinox). repeat
every 400 years. 97 leap years in 400 years. Julian calendar has 100 leap years in 400 years.
Leap years are all years divisible by 4, with the exception of those divisible by 100, but not by 400.

Anno Domini: latin: in the year of our lord.

The Common Era, also known as the Current Era, is the period of measured time beginning with the year 1 on the Gregorian calendar.

equinox: the equinox happens when the Sun is at one of two opposite points on
the celestial sphere where the celestial equator and ecliptic intersect.
In a wider sense, the equinoxes are the two days each year when the center
 of the Sun spends an equal amount of time above and below the horizon at every location on Earth.
The sun is directly above the equator at equinox.
Visualization: there is a location on the surface of the earth where the sun
reaches an altitude of 90 degree. This location moves from north to south
and then back. At equinox, this location is on the equator. At solstice, this
location reaches its most northerly/southerly latitude.
On the day of an equinox, the geometric center of the Sun's disk crosses the equator.
+++
the moment in time when there is a location on the equator where the sun is directly overhead.

Twilight is the time before sunrise or after sunset when sunlight scattered in the upper
atmosphere illuminates the lower atmosphere and the surface of the Earth.
Civil twilight begins in the morning when the center of the Sun is less than 6
below the horizon, and ends at sunrise. Evening civil twilight begins at sunset
and ends when the center of the Sun is more than 6 below the horizon.
+++
dawn: the beginning of morning twilight.
sunrise: is the instant at which the upper edge of the Sun appears above the horizon in the east.
dusk: the end of evening twilight.
sunset: the moment the trailing edge of the sun's disk disappears below the horizon in the west.
twilight: the time between dawn and sunrise, and the time between sunset and dusk.
+++
astronomical dawn: formally defined as the time at which the sun is 18 degrees below the horizon in the morning
nautical dawn: formally defined as the time at which the sun is 12 degrees below the horizon in the morning
civil dawn: formally defined as the time at which the sun is 6 degrees below the horizon in the morning

tropic of cancer: It is the farthest northern latitude at which the sun can
appear directly overhead at noon, an event which occurs on the June solstice.
It is difficult to specify an exact location for both tropic circles because
the obliquity of the ecliptic varies between 22.5 and 24.5 with a 41,000 year periodicity.

The northern solstice is in June on Earth, when the sun is directly over the Tropic of Cancer in the Northern Hemisphere,

"Never increase, beyond what is necessary, the number of entities required to explain anything"
--- William of Ockham (1285-1349)
Occam's razor:
In other words, when multiple competing theories are equal in other respects, the
 principle recommends selecting the theory that introduces the fewest assumptions
and postulates the fewest hypothetical entities.
"when you have two competing theories which make exactly the same predictions, the one that is simpler is the better."

Aesthetics (also spelled esthetics) is a branch of philosophy called value theory or
axiology, which is the study of sensory or sensori-emotional values,
 sometimes called judgments of sentiment and taste.

Camp is an aesthetic in which something has appeal because of its bad taste or ironic value.
Something that is amusing by virtue of its being

public key cryptography:
sender uses recipient's public key to encrypt the message.
recipient uses recipient's private key to decrypt the message.

digital signature: sender encrypts the message using his private key.
Digital signature schemes normally give two algorithms, one for signing which involves the user's
secret or private key, and one for verifying signatures which involves the user's public key.
 The output of the signature process is called the "digital signature."
signing: sender encrypt using sender's private key.
verifying: recipient uses sender's public key.
digital signature: lets the recipient of information verify the information's
origin, and also verify that the information was not tampered with.

Never Let It Be Said that ...

The phrase "Pot calling the kettle black" is an idiom, used to accuse another
speaker of hypocrisy, in that the speaker disparages the subject in a way that
 could equally be applied to him or her. In former times cast iron pots and
 kettles were quickly blackened from the soot of the fire. If personified
into animate objects, the pot would then be hypocritical to insult the
 kettle's colour. The phrase "It takes one to know one" has a similar meaning.

Hypocrisy is the act of condemning another person, when the critic is guilty of the same
thing that is being condemned.

political action committee, is the name commonly given to a private group organized to elect or
defeat government officials in order to promote legislation, often supporting the group's special interests.
A group organized to raise money for their favorite political candidates.

Being carbon neutral, or carbon neutrality, refers to the practice of balancing carbon dioxide
released into the atmosphere from burning fossil fuels, wood, or other sources; with practices
that remove or sequestor carbon from the atmosphere, and use of renewable energy that creates
a similar amount of useful energy without releasing carbon, so that the net carbon emissions are zero.
(carbon offset)

Carbon offsetting is the act of reducing ("offsetting") greenhouse gas emissions.
A well-known example is the planting of trees to compensate for the
greenhouse gas emissions from personal air travel. The idea of paying
 for emission-reductions elsewhere instead of reducing by own actions
is also known from the closely related concept of emissions trading.

carbon footprint: a measure of the impact human activities have on the environment, in terms
of the amount of carbon dioxide produced. A measure of the amount of CO2 emitted
through the combustion of fossil fuels; in the case of an individual, as part of
their daily lives.

The earth's rotation is slowing due to tidal deceleration (gravitational pull from the moon).
The rotation increases due to melting glaciers (water flows from high elevation to low
elevation). The net result is still a decrease in rotational speed.

Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) is a high-precision atomic time standard.
Leap seconds are added to or subtracted from UTC to keep it within 0.9 seconds of UT1.

Universal Time (UT) is a timescale based on the rotation of the Earth. It is
a modern continuation of the Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), i.e., the mean solar time
 on the meridian of Greenwich, England, which is the conventional 0-meridian for
 geographic longitude. GMT is sometimes used, incorrectly, as a synonym for UTC.
The old GMT has been split, in effect, into UTC and UT1.

Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) is a term originally referring to mean solar time
at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich in England. It is now often used to refer
to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) when this is viewed as a time zone,
although strictly UTC is an atomic time scale which only approximates GMT
in the old sense. It is also used to refer to Universal Time (UT), which is the
astronomical concept that directly replaced the original GMT.

Solar time is based on the idea that when the sun reaches its highest point in the sky, it is noon.
The time measured by Earth's rotation relative to the Sun.
a reckoning of the passage of time based on the sun's position in the sky.

Apparent solar time is based on the apparent solar day, which is the interval between two
successive returns of the Sun to the local meridian. Solar time can be measured by a sundial.
Apparent solar time (or true or real solar time) is the time indicated by the Sun on a sundial,
while mean solar time is the average as indicated by clocks.
The average time taken for the sun to return to its highest point is 24 hours.
apparent solar day: the time interval between successive passages of the sun over a local
meridian: not constant because of earth's axial tilt and elliptical shape of earth's orbit.

Mean solar time is artificial clock time adjusted via observations of the diurnal rotation
of the fixed stars to agree with average apparent solar time. The length of a mean solar
 day is a constant 24 hours throughout the year. A time based on a hypothetical sun
moving uniformly along the celestial equator.
Mean solar time, kept by most clocks and watches, is the solar time that
would be measured by observation if the Sun traveled at a uniform apparent speed throughout the year.
To  remedy  the  situation  created  by  apparent  solar  time,  mean  solar  time was
 introduced.  Mean  solar  time  is  based  on  a  fictional  Sun  that
is considered to move at a constant rate of 360 in 24 hours along the celestial  meridian.
 One  mean  day  is  24  hours  in  length,  each  hour consisting of 60 minutes,
and each minute consisting of 60 seconds.

mean sun : an imaginary sun moving uniformly along the celestial equator.

The equation of time is the difference, over the course of a year, between time as read from a sundial and a clock.
The difference between apparent solar time and mean solar time.
The sundial can be ahead (fast) by as much as 16 min 33 s (around November 3)
or fall behind by as much as 14 min 6 s (around February 12).

TAI: international atomic time. not adjusted for leap seconds.
initially, in 1972: TAI - UTC = 10 seconds
as of 2007, total # of leap seconds: 23
	therefore, TAI - UTC = 33 seconds
TAI = UT1 on jan 1 1958
as of 2013: TAI - UTC = 35 seconds

SI second is based on the transition between two energy states in caesium atoms.
defined as a certain number of atomic vibrations.
The SI second that is counted by atomic time standards is currently defined
in such a way that its length matches the nominal second of 1/86400 of a mean solar day between 1750 and 1892.

Cross-sell is a marketing term for the practice of suggesting related products
or services to a customer who is considering buying something. (e.g., would you like fries with that?)

Up-sell is a marketing term for the practice of suggesting higher priced products or
 services to a customer who is considering a purchase. (e.g., Would you like to biggie-size that?")

prototype:  An original type, form, or instance serving as a basis or standard for later stages.
An original, full-scale, and usually working model of a new product or new version of an existing product

loose coupling: means a reduction in assumptions between components.

In computer science, a reference is an object containing information which refers to
 data stored elsewhere, as opposed to containing the data itself. Accessing the
value referred to by a reference is called dereferencing it.
More generally, a reference can be considered as a piece of data that allows
unique retrieval of another piece of data.
A reference may be compared to the address of a house. It is a small identifier
 from which it is possible to find a potentially much larger object.
Finding a house based on its address is analogous to dereferencing a reference.
Dereference a pointer.

32-bit: Most CPUs are currently (as of 2005) designed so that the contents of
a single integer register can store the address (location) of any datum in
the computer's virtual memory. Therefore, the total number of addresses
in the virtual memory  the total amount of data the computer can keep
in its working area  is determined by the width of these registers.
32-bit --> 4G of memory.

load balancer: A load balancer can be used to increase the capacity of a server
 farm beyond that of a single server. It can also allow the service to
continue even in the face of server down time due to server failure or server maintenance.
A load balancer consists of a virtual server (also referred to as vserver or VIP) which,
in turn, consists of an IP address and port. This virtual server is bound to a number
 of physical services running on the physical servers in a server farm. These physical
 services contain the physical server's IP address and port. A client sends a request
 to the virtual server, which in turn selects a physical server in the server farm
and directs this request to the selected physical server. Load balancers are sometimes referred to as "directors"

Designers may not (or, more likely, cannot) be aware of future implementation difficulties

zeitgeist: is originally a German expression that means "the spirit of the age".
It describes the intellectual and cultural climate of an era. In German, the word has
 more layers of meaning than the English translation, including the fact that
 Zeitgeist can only be observed for past events.

A mulligan, in a game, happens when a player gets a second chance to perform a certain move or action.

A QAM tuner is a device present in some digital televisions and similar
devices which enables direct reception of digital cable channels without
 the use of a set-top box. QAM stands for "quadrature amplitude modulation,"
the format by which digital cable channels are encoded and transmitted via
 cable. QAM tuners can be likened to the cable equivalent of an ATSC tuner
 which is required to receive over-the-air (OTA) digital channels broadcast
 by local television stations.
Most cable companies don't encrypt the digital signals that they pick up from local broadcasters.

SDTV: 480i, or 525i (When they broadcast video information, they need
to give CRT-type TVs time to reset the electronic beam to the top
of the screen so it can get ready to paint the next sequence of
lines. So they build in an interframe gap that equals about 45
lines. There is no picture information in this 45 line gap it
is there just to allow the TV time to get ready to receive the next frame).
30 frames per second. 1/60 second in one pass.

EDTV: 480p, or 525p

HDTV: 1080i and 720p

ATSC: used to receive HD signals over the air.

The biggest difference between HDTV signals on a cable system and those
 broadcast over the air revolves around the system used to modulate an
 HDTV signal for transmission as radio-frequency signals across the cable system.
HD signals are modulated for transmission.
Broadcast HDTV uses a system called 8-VSB (vestigial sideband), while cable
usually uses a system called QAM (quadrature amplitude modulation).

For a lot of people, HDTV cable service comes through an HDTV set-top box
(or cable box) that has a built-in QAM tuner.
the channels are also encrypted (scrambled)

In some cable systems, the local broadcast HDTV channels are transmitted across the cable system unencrypted.

*  TVs are being built as digital-cable-ready(DCR) - just as regular analog TVs have been built as
cable-ready for analog cable for years. These DCR TVs have a QAM tuner built-in and a slot for a
"smart card" called the CableCARD.

* Some cable companies rent these CableCARDs to their customers. A customer
 with a CableCARD and a DCR HDTV can simply plug the CableCARD into the HDTV -
the card basically gives your TV "permission" to unscramble encrypted premium channels.

modulation is the process of varying a periodic waveform, i.e. a tone, in order to use that signal to convey a message.

tuner
A tuner is a circuit module or free-standing equipment which detects radio-frequency (RF)
signals usually of low amplitude and amplifies them and converts them to a form suitable for further processing.

radio tuner:
receives radio broadcasts and converts them into audio-frequency signals
 which can be fed into an amplifier driving a loudspeaker.

the time it takes light to fly across 400k km to earth.
you see them as they were a billionth of a second earlier.

relativistic aberration: The shape, position or orientation of an object
seen by a person moving near the speed of light can be quite unusual, and
even different to what is predicted by the non-optical aspects of Einstein's
theory of special relativity, such as length contraction. This is due to
the purely visual effects of angular compression and distortion.
Angular compression:
As we travel faster, light appears to come at us from different angles.
as we travel close to the speed of light, the angles of light coming towards us
from all sides appear to contract, such that more light approaches us from in front.
Among other things, this has the effect of allowing a moving observer
 to see behind them. Watch what happens to an arrow originally behind
the green dot as it accelerates. Aberration allows objects which normally
 make an obtuse angle (greater than 90 degrees) with the direction of
 motion to be wrapped forward into the field of view.
Distortion:
 is a visual effect that arises because the speed of light is not infinite,
so light takes some small amount of time to travel a certain distance.
Therefore, light from distant objects must leave earlier in time than
light from closer objects in order for that light to enter an observer's eye at the same time.
When things move at relativistic speeds, however, this effect is noticeable on a
more local scale. This is because in the short time between seeing one part
of an object and another, its enormous speed allows it to move a significant
distance. This has the effect of making objects appear distorted; possible bent,
 curved or twisted. For example, long rods may appear as parabolic arcs
bending away from the viewer, and cubes can present curved edges or
 non-parallel surfaces. Surprisingly, distortion cancels the effect
 of length contraction in the case of a sphere, which will always
 look circular to a moving observer.

pilot: One who, though not belonging to a ship's company, is licensed to conduct a ship into and out of port or through dangerous waters.
  A television program produced as a prototype of a series being considered for adoption by a network.
pilot light: small auxiliary gas burner that provides a flame to ignite a larger gas burner

A hull is the body of a ship or boat.

In boats and ships, keel can refer to either of two parts: a structural element, or a hydrodynamic element.
A structural keel is a large beam which the hull of a ship is built around.
The keel runs in the middle of the ship, from the bow to the stern, and
 serves as the foundation or spine of the structure, providing the
major source of structural strength of the hull.

Displacement is the actual total weight of the vessel. It is often expressed
in long tons or in metric tons, and is calculated simply by multiplying the
volume of the hull below the waterline (ie. the volume of water it is displacing) by the density of the water.
The word "displacement" arises from the basic physical law, discovered by Archimedes,
 that the weight of a floating object equates exactly to that of the water which
 would otherwise occupy the "hole in the water" displaced by the ship.

Lightship measures the actual weight of the ship with no fuel, passengers, cargo, water, etc. on board.

Deadweight (often abbreviated as DWT for deadweight tonnes) is the displacement at any loaded
 condition minus the lightship weight. It includes the crew, passengers, cargo, fuel, water,
 and stores. Like Displacement, it is often expressed in long tons or in metric tons.

Bulk cargo is commodity cargo that is transported unpackaged in large quantities.
These cargos are usually dropped or poured, with a spout or shovel bucket, as a
 liquid or solid, into a bulk carrier's hold, railroad car, or tanker truck/trailer/semi-trailer
 body. Bulk cargos are classified as liquid or dry.
dry bulk cargo: coal, grain, cement
liquid bulk cargo: petroleum, gasoline

A bulk carrier, bulk freighter, or bulker is a merchant ship used to transport
unpackaged bulk cargo such as cereals, coal, ore, and cement.

Roll-on/roll-off (RORO or ro-ro) ships are designed to carry wheeled cargo such as
automobiles, trailers or railroad cars. This is in contrast to lo-lo (lift on-lift off)
vessels which use a crane to load and unload cargo.

The draft (or draught) of a ship's hull is the vertical distance between the waterline and the
bottom of the hull (keel), with the thickness of the hull included

Tonnage is a measure of the size or cargo capacity of a ship (in units of 100 cubic feet.)

Suezmax is a naval architecture term for the largest ships capable of transiting the Suez Canal fully loaded,

Ships classified as Panamax are of the maximum dimensions that will fit through
the locks of the Panama Canal. This size is determined by the dimensions of the
lock chambers, and the depth of the water in the canal.

A lock is a device for raising and lowering boats between stretches of water of
different levels on river and canal waterways. The distinguishing feature of a
lock is a fixed chamber whose water level can be varied; whereas in a caisson
lock, a boat lift, or on a canal inclined plane, it is the chamber itself
that moves, and is then called a caisson

caisson: A watertight structure within which construction work is carried on under water.

culvert: A sewer or drain crossing under a road or embankment.

A pallet (sometimes called a skid) is a flat transport structure designed to support
 a variety of goods in a stable fashion while being lifted by any mobile forklift,
pallet jack, or other jacking device. The goods are placed on top of the pallet,
 and can be secured to it by straps or stretch-wrapped plastic film.

A Trailer is generally an unpowered vehicle pulled by a powered vehicle. Commonly,
the term trailer refers to such vehicles used for transport of goods and materials.

A semi-trailer is a trailer without a front axle. A large proportion of its weight
is supported either by a road tractor or by a detachable front axle assembly known
 as a dolly or by the tail of another trailer.
A road tractor coupled to a semi-trailer is often called a semi-trailer truck or semi.

Intermodal freight transport involves the transportation of freight in a container
 or vehicle, using multiple modes of transportation (rail, ocean vessel, and truck),
without any handling of the freight itself when changing modes.

Exits will be numbered from south to north and west to east. Each exit number is
determined by the number of miles it is from the beginning of a route. For example,
on Interstate 5, exit No. 1 is just north of the Mexican border and Exit 796 is the
off-ramp before the freeway enters Oregon, 796 miles north of the Mexican border.

loaded for bear: ready and eager to deal with something that is going to be difficult

Cognitive dissonance is a psychological term describing the uncomfortable tension
that may result from having two conflicting thoughts at the same time, or from engaging
in behavior that conflicts with one's beliefs.

Electrical impedance, or simply impedance, describes a measure of opposition
to a sinusoidal alternating current (AC). Electrical impedance extends the
concept of resistance to AC circuits, describing not only the relative
amplitudes of the voltage and current, but also the relative phases.
