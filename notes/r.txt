assignment:
x <- "hello" (preferred)
OR
x = "hello"

f <- function(x) { x + 1 }

vector: a one-dimensional array of homogeneous data types.
v <- c(1,2,3)
s <- 1:5

vector: all elements must be of the same type
Matrix is a special kind of vector. A matrix is a vector with two additional attributes: the number
of rows and the number of columns.

m <- matrix(data=1:6,nrow=2,ncol=3)
     [,1] [,2] [,3]
[1,]    1    3    5
[2,]    2    4    6

Similar to matrix, but arrays can have more than two dimensions.
list can contain elements of different types.
l <- list(1, "ONE")

data frame: a list of vectors of equal length.
> name <- c("Mike", "Lucy", "John")
> age <- c(20, 25, 30)
> student <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)
> df = data.frame(name, age, student)
> df
  name age student
1 Mike  20    TRUE
2 Lucy  25   FALSE
3 John  30    TRUE

install.packages("ggplot2") # in console

read.table(file="name",sep="\t",header=TRUE,quote="\"")
head(tables) #peek
names(table) #look at column name

class(name) #show data type

factor: like enum
factors are variables in R which take on a limited number of different values; such
variables are often refered to as categorical variables. One of the most important uses of factors
is in statistical modeling; since categorical variables enter into statistical models differently
than continuous variables, storing data as factors insures that the modeling functions will treat
such data correctly.

qualitative variable: categorical value
quantitative variable: numerical value

location: measure of central tendency

apply - When you want to apply a function to the rows or columns or both of a matrix and output is a one-dimensional if only row or column is selected else it is a 2D-matrix
lapply - When you want to apply a function to each element of a list in turn and get a list back.
sapply - When you want to apply a function to each element of a list in turn, but you want a vector back, rather than a list.
tapply - When you want to apply a function to subsets of a vector and the subsets are defined by some other vector, usually a factor.
