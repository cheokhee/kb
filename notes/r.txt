assignment:
x <- "hello" (preferred)
OR
x = "hello"

f <- function(x) { x + 1 }

vector: a one-dimensional array of homogeneous data types.

s <- 1:5

m <- matrix(data=1:6,nrow=2,ncol=3)
     [,1] [,2] [,3]
[1,]    1    3    5
[2,]    2    4    6

l <- list(1, "ONE")

install.packages("ggplot2") # in console

read.table(file="name",sep="\t",header=TRUE,quote="\"")
head(tables) #peek
names(table) #look at column name

class(name) #show data type

factor: like enum
factors are variables in R which take on a limited number of different values; such
variables are often refered to as categorical variables. One of the most important uses of factors
is in statistical modeling; since categorical variables enter into statistical models differently
than continuous variables, storing data as factors insures that the modeling functions will treat
such data correctly.

qualitative variable: categorical value
quantitative variable: numerical value

location: measure of central tendency
