V1: MapReduce contains both resource management and data processing
V2: MapReduce: only data processing. YARN: resource management.

MapReduce: high latency

YARN: resource manager and node manager

HDFS: name node and data node

Apache Pig: a scripting languauge for MapReduce
Apache Hive: an SQL-like interface to MapReduce. Also data warehousing.
Pig/Hive: turn queries into jobs that run on MapReduce.
Apache Samza: used by linkedin
Apache Storm: used by Twitter. real-time
Apache Spark: in-memory analytic engine
ZooKeeper: maintain config info
Ambari:
Avro: data serialization system
Flume: gather data from multiple sources and put them into HDFS
Chukwa: data collection system
HBase:
HCatalog:
Hue:
Mahout: recommendation engine
Giraph: graph processing
Oozie: orchestrate mapreduce jobs.
Sqoop: transfer data between HDFS and relational database
Kafka: distributed messaging system
Apache Drill: MapR. interactive analysis of large data sets
Impala: Cloudera. real-time processing of big data.

Hadoop streaming: allows you to create and run Map/Reduce jobs with any executable or script as the mapper and/or the reducer. For example:
$HADOOP_HOME/bin/hadoop  jar $HADOOP_HOME/hadoop-streaming.jar \
    -input myInputDirs \
    -output myOutputDir \
    -mapper /bin/cat \
    -reducer /bin/wc
