V1: MapReduce contains both resource management and data processing
V2: MapReduce: only data processing. YARN: resource management.

MapReduce: high latency

YARN: resource manager and node manager

HDFS: name node and data node

Apache Pig: a scripting languauge for MapReduce
Apache Hive: an SQL-like interface to MapReduce. Also data warehousing.
Apache Hive: a data warehouse software
Pig/Hive: turn queries into jobs that run on MapReduce.
Apache Samza: used by linkedin

Apache Impala is a modern, open source, distributed SQL query engine for Apache Hadoop.
Apache Impala : an open source massively parallel processing (MPP) SQL query engine for hadoop
HUE: hadoop user experience

Hadoop: an Open Source framework for writing applications which processes structured and
unstructured data that are stored in HDFS.

Hadoop streaming: allows you to create and run Map/Reduce jobs with any executable or script as the mapper and/or the reducer. For example:
$HADOOP_HOME/bin/hadoop  jar $HADOOP_HOME/hadoop-streaming.jar \
    -input myInputDirs \
    -output myOutputDir \
    -mapper /bin/cat \
    -reducer /bin/wc
