create keys:

--> ssh-keygen -t rsa

This will place the private key in ~/.ssh/id_rsa and the public key in ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.

copy id to remote host: create ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
ssh-copy-id user@host

== old way
Now, append the contents of ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub to the end of ~/.ssh/authorized_keys on the remote machine.
For example:

 $ cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh host 'cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys'

after this, it won't ask for password

#1. local (outgoing)
A-->(encrypted)B-->(plaintext)C

On A: ssh user@B -L A_port:C:C_port
Users on A: ssh -p A_port localhost uname -a

#2. remote (incoming)
B-->(encrypted)C-->(plaintext)A

On C: ssh user@B -R B_port:A:A_port
users on B: ssh -p B_port localhost uname -a
