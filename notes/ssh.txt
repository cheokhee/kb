create keys:

--> ssh-keygen -t rsa

This will place the private key in ~/.ssh/id_rsa and the public key in ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.

copy id to remote host: create ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
ssh-copy-id user@host

== old way
Now, append the contents of ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub to the end of ~/.ssh/authorized_keys on the remote machine.
For example:

 $ cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh host 'cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys'

after this, it won't ask for password

port forwarding
#1. local (outgoing)
A-->(encrypted)B-->(plaintext)C

On A: ssh user@B -L A_port:C:C_port
Users on A: ssh -p A_port localhost uname -a

#2. remote (incoming)
B-->(encrypted)C-->(plaintext)A

On C: ssh user@B -R B_port:A:A_port
users on B: ssh -p B_port localhost uname -a

execute remote command:
ssh user@host "tail -f file"

ssh user@remote_host "cat remote_file.txt" | diff - local_file.txt

ssh tunnel:
Basically, it makes a port on your laptop that gets sent over SSH to a port on the server. You then
connect to the localhost port (in this case, 5901):
ssh -L 5901:localhost:5901 -i ~/mykeyfile.pem ubuntu@myec2hostname

windows workaround:
copy the key files under %userprofile%/.ssh to C:\Program Files (x86)\Git\.ssh or
D:\Git\.ssh (wherever git is installed)

sshpass -p "n2c3" scp -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no n2c3@IPaddress:/home/n2c3/snapshot/data.tar.gz .
