create keys:

--> ssh-keygen -t rsa

This will place the private key in ~/.ssh/id_rsa and the public key in ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.

Now, append the contents of ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub to the end of ~/.ssh/authorized_keys on the remote machine.
For example:

 $ cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh host 'cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys'

after this, it won't ask for password
